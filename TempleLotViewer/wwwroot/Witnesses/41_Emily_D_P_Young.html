  <answer>Well I will tell it as near as I can, I was living at his house at the time, and had been living there for quite a while after my father's death, for he died there in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>22</questionnumber>
  <question>You were living at whose house?</question>
  <answer>The prophet's house, and he came there into the room where I was one day, when I was in the room alone, and asked me if I could keep a secret. I was about eighteen years of age then I think, - at any rate I was quite young. He asked me if I could keep a secret, and I told him I thought I could, and then he told me that he would sometime if he had an opportunity, - he would tell me something that would be for my benefit, if I would not betray him, and I told him I wouldn't. Well it run along for a good while, - I don't know just how long, and there was no opportunity of saying anything, to me more than he had, and one day he sat in the room alone, and I passed through it, and he called to me, or spoke to me, and called me to him, and then he said that he had intended to tell me something, but he had no opportunity to do so, and so he would write me a letter, if I would agree to burn it as soon as I read it, and with that I looked frightened, for I thought there was something about it that was not just right, and so I told him that I would rather that he would not write to me, - that I would not write to me any letter, and then he asked me if I wanted him to say any more, and I said yes, that I did not want to hear anything more about it at all, for I had got a little frightened about it. Well it went on in that condition, and there was not anything more said about it for several months not until 1843 I think, - some time in 1843, for he had no other opportunity until then, and I did not think he would ever say anything more about it until then, but I had thought a great deal about it in that time, and I had prayed for it to know what it was, and if it was my duty I thought I ought to have listened to it, - that is to what he was going to tell me or write to me, for I was greatly troubled over it, as I feared I had done wrong in not listening to it, and so I prayed to be enlightened in regard to what I should have done. Well in time I became convinced that there was nothing wrong about it, and that it would be right for me to hear what he had to say, but there was nothing more said for a good while after I came to that conclusion. I think it was months before there was anything more said about it, - but I don't know just how long it was but he spoke to me again, and wanted an opportunity to speak to me and I granted it.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff moves the court to exclude the answer of the witness from the record for the reason that it is not responsive to the question.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>23</questionnumber>
  <question>Well go on and finish your answer?</question>
  <answer>He told me then what he wanted to say to me, and he taught me this principle of plural marriage that is called polygamy, now, but we called it celestial marriage, and he told me that his principle had been revealed to him but it was not generally known; and he went on and said that the Lord had given me to him, and he wanted to know if I would consent to a marriage, and I consented.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>24</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were you married to him?</question>

    </pagenumber>married to him on the 4th day of March 1843, and after that in the same year. I think it was in May, Emma had consented that he should have more wives than one, and as she had consented to this, we were married again I think it was in May, for she had given her consent that we should be married, - that she had chosen myself and my sister, and we were married in her presence again because we thought proper to say nothing about the former marriage, and it was done over again on the 11th of May 1843 in her presence, and she gave her consent fully and freely and voluntarily.

  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the reason the ceremony was performed the second time?</question>
  <answer>Well Emma had a good many feelings we supposed, - she was a rather high strung woman of a very nervous organization, and we thought that she had her feelings, and so we thought there was no use in saying anything about it, for so long as she had chosen us herself, - there was no use of having another ceremony only for that reason. That is the only reason I know for not saying anything about it.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiffs objects to the answer of the witness on the ground that it details or purports to detail the substance of an agrement or conversation that occured between a prty who is living and one who is dead, and therefore it is incompetent, and moves the court to strike the answer from the record for that reason.</mono>

  <answer>Well there was a revelation given, - printed after I was married to him, but this revelation that was given before that was not printed or generally known, but there was one printed soon after that, that I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>42</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you mean that it was printed or written?</question>

  <questionnumber>346</questionnumber>
  <question>Let me refresh your recollection by reading from page two hundred and twenty six from the affidavit of William Clayton in the same book, - "Hyrum then took the revelation to read to Emma. Joseph remained in the office with me until Hyrum returned. When he came back Joseph asked him how he had succeeded, and Hyrum replied that he had never received a more severe talking to in his life; that Emma was very bitter and full of dissapointment and anger, and Joseph quietly remarked" I told you, you did not know Emma as well as I did", Joseph then put the revelation in his pocket, and they both left and office". Now that affidavit was made in July 1843, and that affidavit of Clayton's states that that attention to in regard to what transpired there occured in July 1843 more than two or three months after the times you say you were married in May? Is that not a fact?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason "that there is no evidence to show that what counsel has read to the witness is any part of an affidavit made by Clayton".</mono>
  <answer>That is all right. That occured after our marriage - for she was very bitter over it after the marriage but she consented to it at the time. I said before that she was bitter after that, and if I did not I meant to say so, and I think I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>347</questionnumber>
  <question>She turned bitter then from the minute you were married?</question>

  <question>Well it is in your biography here?</question>
  <answer>Say what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>350</questionnumber>
  <question>That she turned butter from the minute that you were married?</question>
  <answer>Well I might have said that, but I meant from a short time after we were married. It might have been from the hour we were married. I know she was bitter soon after that, but I can't say how long it was afterwards that she got that way, but I know it was very soon after that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>351</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about what time did she turn bitter?</question>

    <question>I will read an article taken from the book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, on marriage.</question><answer>&nbsp;</answer>
    <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds as above set forth, and for the further reason "that objection is made to the article proposed to be read on the ground that the book from which it purports to be taken is the best evidence as to what the doctrine of what the church was".</mono>
    
  <questionnumber>583</questionnumber>
    <question>The article I propose to read being the same identical article as the section on marriage in the 1835 edition of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, marked exhibit "E" heretofore introduced as evidence.</question>
    <mono>
      By Mr. Cabell, "We make the same objection to that, and also on the further ground that there is no evidence there to show that it is the same". By Mr. Kelley, "The article herein set out, and which we propose to read to the witness being the same identical article in the book of Doctrine and Covenants above specified, word for word, the article is as follows, (It is headed) From the book of Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. On marriage. According to the custom of all civilized nations, marriage is regulated by laws and ceremonies; therefore we believe that all marriages in this church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, should be solemnized in a public meeting or feast prepared for that purpose; and that the solemnization should be performed by a presiding high priest, high priest, bishop, elder or priest, not even prohibiting those persons who are desirous to get married, of being married by other authority. We believe that it is not right to prohibit members of this church from marrying our of the church, if it be their determination so to do, but such persons will be considered weak in the faith of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Marriage should be celebrated with prayer and thanksgiving, and at the solemnization the persons to be married, standing together, the man on the right, and the woman on the left, shall be addressed by the person officiating, as he shall be directed by the Holy Spirit; and if there be no legal objections, he shall say, calling each by their names;" You both mutually agree to be each others companion, husband and wife, observing the legal rights belonging to this condition; that is keeping yourselves wholly for each other, and from all others during your lives". And when they have answered "yes" he shall pronounce them "husband and wife" in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the laws of the country and authority vested in him; "may God add his blessings, and keep you to fulfill your covenants, from henceforth, and for ever. Amen" The clerk of every church should keep a record of all marriages, solemnized in his branch. All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is baptized into this church, should be held sacred and fulfilled. In as much as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy; we declare that we believe that one man should have but one wife and one woman but one husband, except in case of death when either is at liberty to marry again. It is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will of her husband, neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband. All children are bound by law to

      </pagenumber>obey their parents; and to influence them to embrace any religious faith, or be baptized, or leave their parents without their consent is unlawful and unjust. We believe that husbands, parents and masters, who exercise control over their wives, children and servants, and prevent them from embracing the truth, will have to answer for that sin". Now that is the section on marriage and I will give you the editorial comments on it. We have given the above rule of marriage as the only one practiced in this church, to show that Dr. J.C. Bennett's "secret wife system" is a matter of his own manufacture; and further to disabuse the public ear, and shew that the said Bennett, and his misanthropic friend Origen Bachelor, are perpetrating a foul and infamous slander upon an innocent people, and need but to be known to be hated and despised. In support of this petition we present the following certificate. Now I have read that with the editorial comment for the purpose of refreshing your recollection, as you say you have no remembrance of it, and I will ask you now if you have any recollection of these certificates?

    <question>Were not all these women whose names I have read prominent women there in the church in Nauvoo, in the church work?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir, I suppose they were. As far as I knew they were, - some of them I knew where, but as I did now know the others, or cannot remember them, I cannot say. I cannot say as to all of them. 670 (Mistakenly listed as a second number 669)</answer>
    <question>And still you want to go on record as saying that after this statement made by so many prominent women in the work of the church there at Nauvoo, and members of he church, whose husbands also in a great many instances occupied prominent offices and important offices in connection with the government of the church, - that you do not know anything about the practice being denounced of polygamy?</question>
    <answer>I don't say that, - I do not say that it was not denounced I say that I don't remember anything about it, but it probably was. I have no doubt but what it was published just as it is there and at the time too.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>671</questionnumber>

    <question>Well he talked over the secret wife system with you, didn't he?</question>
    <answer>What?</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>676</questionnumber>
    <question>He talked secret wife to you in 1842 didn't he?</question>
    <answer>I don't know that he said about secret wives or anything of the kind in 1842. I don't know that he said a word about it in 1842. I have told you that he came to me first one day in his house, when he and I were together, and he said that he had something to tell me if I could keep a secret, and he would tell me if he could get an opportunity, and he did not say anything about what it was he was going to tell me that time; and then after that some time, - I don't know how long, - he met me again and spoke to me about it, but I did not know what he meant then until some time afterwards. That was the second time he spoke to me about it, and that was the time that he told me he would write me a letter, and I told him that I did not want him to write me a letter, - that was in 1842 I think, - I would not be positive but I thin it was, and there was nothing said about secret wives at any of these times.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>677</questionnumber>
    <question>Well did you not say that before he spoke to you he second time and spoke about writing the letter to you, that you found out outside what it was, that he was going to say or write to you?</question>

  <questionnumber>678</questionnumber>
    <question>Then he never said anything to you about polygamy?</question>
    <answer>Not at that time.</answer>

    <question>Was it called the "plural wife" system?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>685</questionnumber>
    <question>Is that the term he employed in speaking to you about it?</question>
    <answer>I don't remember all that he did do or say. I can't remember just what he said, - that is impossible. It was "celestial marriage", or "plural marriage" or some thing of that kind that he called it.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>686</questionnumber>
    <question>Well now as a fact, don't you know that there was a revelation on sealing?</question>

    <answer>Well I know I thought it was all the same.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>689</questionnumber>
    <question>Well now don't you know they are two seperate and distinct documents?</question>
    <answer>Well that may be, but the principle is the same and you may called it plural marriage or polygamy or whatever you please and that don't make a bit of difference for the principle is the same whatever name it is called by.</answer>

    <answer>No sir, I should think not.</answer>

    <question>Well he says on July 12th 1843 to prepare thyself to receive and obey the instructions which he was about to give, and then he goes on and give the instructions with reference to polygamy or the revelation regarding polygamy - which you regard as the revelation on polygamy.

  <questionnumber>913</questionnumber>
    <question>Well do you know anything about it, - whether it was written or not at the time you were married to him?</question>

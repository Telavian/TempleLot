  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "That is objected to as immeterial, and not cross examination."</mono>
  <answer>By the authority of the common consent of the body, which is a rule of action of the body.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>39</questionnumber>
  <question>Now, what body do you refer to? Do you refer to the local church at Lamoni, or not?</question>

  <questionnumber>44</questionnumber>
  <question>now then Mr Kelley, will you explain, how it is that one local church may incorporate itself, and thereby exercise jurisdiction or authority over the property within the jurisdiction of other churches in other states?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "I object to the question for the reason that it is incompetent and immeterial, and not cross examination, and calls for the opinion of the witness on a question of law, when the testimony of the witness already given shows that he is a minister and not a lawyer, therefore his opinion is not worth anything on an opinion of law." By Mr Southern, - "Well I think he is a lawyer, - and a pretty good one at that."</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>45</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you understand the question?</question>

  <questionnumber>46</questionnumber>
  <question>How asked you to explain how one local church may incorporate itself, and thereby exercise authority over property within the jurisdiction of other churches in other states?</question>
  <answer>Under the laws of the state of Iowa, provision is made for the incorporation of local societies, and providing in such corporation supervision in the manner of a presbytery, synod or general convention of churches, of all other churches, and so the incorporation of this church is made. We hold property in other states by virtue of the law of comity existing between the states.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>47</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr Kelley you state that you were the Bishop of the Re-organized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>48</questionnumber>
  <question>And you are at the present time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>49</questionnumber>
  <question>How many Bishops are there?</question>
  <answer>There is but one at the present time, - that is there is but one at the present time that is acting in the office of Bishop, - But the Bishop has counselors to assist and advise him.</answer>
  <question>You may state whether or not the bishop of that Church is the highest officer in it?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "That question is objected because it is not cross-examination, and not the best evidence." By Mr Southern, -</mono>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>50</questionnumber>
  <question>You are not the highest officer, - or rather the Bishop is not the highest officer?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>51</questionnumber>

  <answer>The highest officer in the church is, the, -</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "That is also objected to, - that question is objected to for the reasons given in the last objection, and it is immeterial."</mono>
  <answer>The highest officer in the church is the President, or presiding elder in the Church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>52</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you spoke about the incorporation of the local church at Lamoni, and you stated if I recollect correctly your testimony, - that it was authorized by the general Conference? If I recollect correctly that is what you testified to?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>53</questionnumber>
  <question>Now did the general Conference authorize an incorporation of the church or branch at Lamoni, Iowa., in contra-distinction between the incorporation of any other branch or church of the denomination?</question>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "That is immeterial and not the best evidence, - the best evidence being now in the possession of the attorney asking the question. The question is objected to for that reason."</mono>
  <answer>The resolution is general, and any branch of the church in any state, where such corporations are permitted under the laws of the state might act in harmony with the resolution and incorporate; but my recollection is that there was a special resolution with reference to the incorporation of the church at Lamoni in the state of Iowa. Now that is my best recollection of the facts in connection with that matter.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>54</questionnumber>
  <question>Will you state why an incorporation of the church was not made at Independence, Missouri., instead of the church at Lamoni, Iowa?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "That is objected to as immeterial, and incompetent, and calling for the opinion of the witness only". By Mr Southern, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>55</questionnumber>
  <question>I ask you if you know, - if you can state why it was not had at Independence, Missouri., rather than at Lamoni, Iowa?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I know. It was because we preferred to incorporate under the laws of the state of Iowa.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>56</questionnumber>
  <question>You allege, or it is alleged in the Bill in this cause, that the Re-organized Church of Latter Day Saints, was, - I believe it is at a blank date, - incorporated in the State of Illinois? Now is that true?</question>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "That is objected to as immeterial, and not proper cross-examination."</mono>
  <answer>I could not state from my personally knowledge Colonel in reference to that. I only know that I did not take part in the original corporation.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>57</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then is it incorporated at any other place to your knowledge only at Lamoni and at this point in Illinois?</question>
  <answer>The incorporation at the present time is at Lamoni.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>58</questionnumber>
  <question>And it is not incorporated at, - or rather in Illinois?</question>
  <answer>The Lamoni incorporation is a re-incorporation of the church in Illinois, -the Lamoni incorporation is a re-incorporation of that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>59</questionnumber>
  <question>Now is there any other incorporation in any other state of which you are aware?</question>
  <answer>Not that I am aware of. Could I look at that paper just a moment Colonel (witness refers to Exhibit A)</answer>

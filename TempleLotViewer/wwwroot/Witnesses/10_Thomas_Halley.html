It was fenced in the summer of 1883 some time but I don't think there was any trees put on it until in the fall of that year. Now that is the best of my recollection about it. I know the time it was fenced for the old gentleman that fenced it was living up at our house for four years, and I was glad to see it fenced, for it lay there rough and tumble as a loose lot, and was used as a camping ground for circuses, and for a circus ground or any other purpose that people who came along wanted to use it for.</answer>

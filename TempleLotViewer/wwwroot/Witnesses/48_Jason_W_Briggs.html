  <answer>I think I made a mistake there that I wish to correct. This question brings it to my mind that it was in 1850 instead of 1849 that the final breaking off with Strang took place. It should be 1850 instead of 1849.</answer>

  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is not a very serious error for you said, as I understood you, that it was about 1850 that it took place?</question>
  <answer>Well I want to be as exact as possible in this, and when you speak about William Smith and his church it brings it to my mind that it was in the last days of 1850 that I left Strang, and about the first days of 1851, or rather the last days of 1850, that this acceptance of William Smith took palce.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>108</questionnumber>
  <question>Then how long did you continue with him?</question>
  <answer>With William Smith?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>109</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well I continued with him until the next fall, - that would be the fall of 1851. I was with him a little less than a year.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>110</questionnumber>
  <question>State what your reasons were, if there were any at all, for your not continuing with him any longer?</question>
  <answer></answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and leading.</mono>
  <answer>Well the reasons were the same, - they were very similiar to a great extent, to the reasons that caused us to leave Strang. They were very similiar to the reasons that caused us to reject Strang, I got to believe, and the branch there got to believe that he taught error, - that he taught false doctrines that we could not accept.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>111</questionnumber>
  <question>State what false doctrine it was that he taught that you could not accept?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds, and for the reasons above set forth, and because it is leading.</mono>
  <answer>Well it was the old story, - plurality of wives was one thing, and perhaps the main thing, and in addition to that as I have before stated, he claimed subsequent to my first acquaintance with him, that it was his right to preside over the church. It was his by right he claimed, instead of his standing as a guardian or representative of the rightful heir. He claimed that publicly as his right, and when he did so we refused to accept it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>112</questionnumber>
  <question>You said that one of the false doctrines was that of plurality of wives?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>113</questionnumber>
  <question>Or polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that was one of the doctrines that we considered false and refused to accept.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>114</questionnumber>
  <question>State the circumstances, if you can, by which you became acquainted with the face that he was teaching that doctrine.?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is leading, and incompetent, and irrelevant "to any of the issues in this case".</mono>
  <answer>Well the circumstances were simply these: His counsellor first broached the matter to me. He talked it first in a round about way and then directly, and finally William Smith claimed to have received a revelation authorizing the practice of having "plurality of wives, and he taught it, and that was the way I became acquainted with the teaching of it sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>115</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see the revelation, or hear it read?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I saw it and heard it read.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>116</questionnumber>
  <question>State where and when you saw it and heard it read</question>

    </pagenumber>on the ground that it is inadmissible and incompetent, and irrelevant, and because it is not comketent evidence, nor the best evidence, - the record evidence which is always the best evidence, on that subject being introduced in evidence.

  <question>Is that all that was done?</question>
  <answer>There was also some high priests and some of the seventies chosen.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>213</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state whether or not this was done by virtue of a revelation, or was it simply done by the action of the conference?</question>
  <answer>Well I would say it was partly both.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>214</questionnumber>
  <question>Please explain what you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>Well I mean to say it was partly by revelation and partly by act of conference.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>215</questionnumber>
  <question>It was partly the act of the conference acting on its own responsibility, and partly done by virtue of a revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>216</questionnumber>
  <question>State if you can to whom, or through whom this revelation was given?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and does not call for the best evidence.</mono>
  <answer>That particular revelation that is referred to in that last answer was given to Henry Deems.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>217</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state what part Henry Deems took in that conference?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>219</questionnumber>
  <question>now I will get you to look on page fifty five at the bottom of the page, commencing at the word "verily" thus saith the Lord" in the fifteenth line from the bottom. Now read that and see if that is not the revelation referred to as having been given through Henry Deems?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that the article he is asked to read is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and has nothing whatever to do with any of the issues in this case.</mono>
  <answer>What is that question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>220</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you identify what I have directed your attention to as the revelation that was given to Henry Deems?</question>
  <answer>It purports to be the same one, but it is not exactly correct. It is correct with the exception of that "ten" in there. It should be "assisted by two others" instead of "ten" others. It reads assisted by "ten others", and it should read "assisted by two others".</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>221</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is a typographical error, - it is a misprint? Read it.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the quotation referred to being read in evidence, for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immerterial, and it has been shown by the witness that the paper is not correct.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>222</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state whether or not it is correct with the exception of that one particular to which you have referred?</question>
  <answer>I think so. I think it is the same. I don't think there is anything else materially wrong about it. Well there is another defect. The word "senior" was in that document, - the "senior shall preside." With that exception and the other one I have spoken of it is correct. With these two exceptions it is correct.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>223</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it reads, - "the senior of them shall stand as a representative"?</question>
  <answer>Well that is in there.</answer>

  <question>I will ask you to state whether or not the whole pamphlet including the three extra pages, was authorized by the conference?</question>

  <question>Answer the question?</question>
  <answer>The conference authorized the publication of a pamphlet, setting forth the position we occupied, and the committee in preparing it we not confined to any particular number of pages or to any particular space.

  </question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not the best evidence.</mono>
  <answer>I think there was and still I do not remember distinctly what was done by the conference. I apprehend that the pamphlet itself will give you more exact and correct information on what was done in that respect than I can. 240 (Mistakenly written as 340)</answer>
  <question>Well do you recollect that there was anything added to it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I recollect that there was an addition of three pages made to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>241</questionnumber>
  <question>Now to refresh your recollection I will read from page twenty one commencing at the top of the page, - "We cannot forego this opportunity to raise our voice against an evil which has well nigh completed the over-throw of the church, which Sampson like, hath lain hold of upon the pillars of society, and instead od order it has produced anarchy; instead of union, division; in short, instead of confidence and love, distrust and hatred. We refer to the system of spiritual wifery taught by Brigham Young, and the plurality doctrines of James J Strang, and the fouler system of whoredoms taught by William Smith and his joint occupant called spokesman. These systems though unlike each other, are all known as a system of polygamy, under which they, themselves take shelter; hence we will not treat of them under their proper names, but under the less offensive, or semi-legal one, viz, polygamy". I will ask you if you can identify them as a part of the word of consolation that you were appointed to writ?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons above set forth.</mono>
  <answer>It is a part of the pamphlet that was written and prepared after the rest of it had been written. These three pages here had been written and prepared after the rest of it was written, for when it was reported to the conference it thought it was not just explicit enough, so it was reported back again to the committee, and these three pages were added, I am not sure nut that was written after the rest of it had been accepted by the Conference. I rather think it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>242</questionnumber>
  <question>And then it was printed as shown here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>243</questionnumber>
  <question>By what authority were these three pages written?</question>
  <answer>Well I though I explained that, but perhaps I did not fully enough. The fact is that there had been a manifestation through some of the members of the church in regard to this polygamous practice, - this polygamous doctrine and it had been shown in that manifestation or manifesto that it should be struck at more directly and vigorously, than it had been in the pamphlet in the first place as it was presented to the conference, and hence these three pages were written to do that as suggested in the manifestation. Now that is about the whole truth of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>244</questionnumber>
  <question>Then as a matter of fact it was done through and by the authority of a revelation, - that is these three pages were?</question>
  <answer>Well I have said all I have to say in regard to that. It was done in the way I have stated, and whether it was done in the way I have stated, and whether it was done by the authority of a revelation is something that you can conclude as well as I can.</answer>

  <question>I will ask you to state whether or not the statement made here in regard to William Smith was true?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say. All that I can say is that the committee believed it to be true or it would not have gone in there. I know that I was one of the committee believed it to be true or I should not have consented to its going in there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>248</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state whether or not you knew it was true?</question>

  <question>In exhibit "O", which is a volume of the Times and Seasons in the number published in the city of Nauvoo, Illinois on Saturday June 1st 1844 at the head of the editorial columns appeared this, - "For President, General Joseph Smith, Nauvoo, Illinois: for vice President Sidney Rigdon, Esq' of Pennsylvania"., and in the second column of the same page, the same being page five hundred and fifty two, commencing at the top of the page and reading the article entitled "A word to the wise?, down to the words "do beware". I will read it to you as follows, - Some people are so very religious that their religion sticks out so far that their neighbors tread upon it, and then there is a fuss among the brethern, and surmises, and murmurings, and sometimes a little uneasiness that somebody had fall form grace. To prevent such unnecessary trouble, and save many from thinking wrong, and in fact, from doing wrong, we have thought advisable to caution all against the practice of judging others, until they have been weighed in the balance, and are not found wanting themselves. The Times and Seasons contain religious and political articles, syas one; to which we reply, certainly, and so does the bible. Go ahead saints and reform the world in religion and politics, in ways and means in power and glory, in truth and virtue. In stead of judging others and talking continually about their faults, correct your own. Thou fool, first case the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou can see clearly the moat in thy brother's eye. The highest folly that disgraces the United States is that truth and holiness, and which combined and practiced, compose religion, should not be mixed with power and policy, which is the essence of government, because some tyro from Gottingen, or some other college had joined in the yell of demagogues, that that would be uniting church and state. God save the king, who ever heard of such wickedness. Union, virtue, truth, holiness, policy and power. Look out lest you should combine and give peace to the world and save treasure and blood, Beware, beware, lest a "thus saith the Lord", should be a better rule to govern the people, than an "I take the responsibility". Do beware "Do you recognize that"?</question>

  <questionnumber>351</questionnumber>
  <question>In the matter of your seperation from the church, was it not a matter of preceedure and church policy that you did not agree with more, than anything else?</question>
  <answer>On an occasion of what kind?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>352</questionnumber>
  <question>One the occasion of your action in seperating from the church?</question>
  <answer>Well now that is a hard question for me to answer, for I can answer that question both yes and no, and therefore I find it rather difficult to answer the question. I cannot answer that question either yes, or no, and o justice to myself or you either. I can answer it, if you want me to do so in my own way I will do it, but as I said I will have to have some latitude.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>353</questionnumber>
  <question>I will put it in this way, - whether there was any vital of doctrine changes in the church that your action was based on in seperating from the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not say that. I did not allege there was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>354</questionnumber>

  <question>I will ask you if you did not a few weeks after you seperated, and had it published in the "Saints Herald" in which you stated these words substantially that had the decisions of the reorganized church been made as made in the answer to your request, that possibly there would have been no ossasion for your withdrawal".</question>

  <questionnumber>356</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that not substantially what you stated?</question>
  <answer>I say I remember some things of that kind, but whether that is exactly what I stated or not I do not know. I think it is altogether likely that you have stated substantially what was said. I remember it substantially something of that kind. I will answer that if you are willing, and give the exact fact as I remember it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>357</questionnumber>
  <question>Well the question is answered with reference to any great change, and that is all that is necessary to be said I think?</question>
  <answer>
    It was not in the vial doctrines that any thing new was brought in, but it was the interpretation put on certain lines of policy and doctrine, and while others were allowed to discuss those lines of policy I was not permitted to do so, but was shut out. I could not be heard, and consequently as I expressed it at the time, I was gagged and bound and did not have an opportunity to answer and express my views as I thought I had a right to do. That was

    </pagenumber>my views, as I thought I had a right to do. That was what I objected to more particularly, and not to any change of the vital doctrines of the church. That was the way I looked at it, and when that condition came to pass I felt that I was out of place in the council or in fellowship with people that were not satisfied with attempting to bind me, but must needs attempt to gag me as well. 358 (Written as 258)

  <questionnumber>364</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you mean that your recollection is that you attended it?</question>

  <question>Well that is it. I only wanted to call your attention to it, for I was there, and I knew that you were not there?</question>
  <answer>Well I was not there, and I don't think I said I was there. If I said I was there I was mistaken for I am sure that I was not there. Now that brings it to my mind that I should have answered in answer to the question as to whether or not I attended the general conferences, I should have said that I generally did attend them for the first eight or nine years after the reorganization, but after that I did not invariably attend them.</answer>

  <answer>Well I have been. Yes sir I have accounted my self a member of that church from that time on, but I have been in different organizations at different times as I have already stated, but when in each of these organizations I supposed I was under the church. When I foung out that they were teaching or practicing anything that was not authorized by the church prior to 1844 as the law is set forth in the bible, the book of Mormon, and the book of Doctrine and Covenants, why I left it at once. Now at the time, as I have stated, that I belonged to these different organizations I always supposed they were the true and direct descendant of the original church, and as soon as my error was revealed to me I left them, I left them as soon as I found they were not under the church.</answer>

    </pagenumber>now what you are driving at. "For what period of time, - I think you will have to make your meaning clearer before I can answer that question.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>386</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I mean this, - for what period of time was he to be the successor of Joseph Smith, according to his own teaching?</question>
  <answer>Well in accepting James J. Strang as the head of the church we accepted him as being the regular, genuine successor of Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>387</questionnumber>
  <question>Well for what period of time was he to be the successor of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>For the period of his life, - while he lived. 387 (Mistakenly listed as a second number 387)</answer>
  <question>While he lived, he was to be the head of the church.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>388</questionnumber>
  <question>Now that is your understanding of it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>389</questionnumber>
  <question>Now let me refresh your memory on that point? Do you not know that his teaching was that he was appointed until the seed of Joseph Smith should fill Joseph Smith's place, and that Strang was to be King when the see of Joseph Smith should fill Joseph Smith's place? I call your attention to, that Mr Briggs for the purpose of refreshing your recollection?</question>
  <answer>Subsequently to my acceptance of the leadership of Strang that idea crept out.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>390</questionnumber>
  <question>What idea crept out?</question>
  <answer>That idea of claim of what ever it was called, about his successor, but I always understood that Strang claimed to be the legitimate successor of Joseph Smith by virtue of an appointment that he had received from Joseph Smith himself to be his successor.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>391</questionnumber>
  <question>It was through and by virtue of that letter of appointment from Joseph Smith, that he claimed to have received?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>392</questionnumber>
  <question>That was what you understood his claim was based upon?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>393</questionnumber>
  <question>And as soon as you and the other saints that had joined his organization found out that he was teaching other things that what had been taught in the original church, and which were not authorized by the doctrine of the church why then you discarded him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. We did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>394</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you were asked by what authority Zenas H. Gurley raised up the branch at Palestine, and you answered that you thought he was a member of Strangs church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>395</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you if he was not authorized as a minister in the original church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, he was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>396</questionnumber>
  <question>What office did he in fact hold in that church?</question>
  <answer>Well he was an elder at least. I do not know of anything else.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>397</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he not one of the Seventy?</question>
  <answer>I am not aware that he was, and still he might have been. Let me see, - very likely he was, but still I don't know that he was. He was made a President of the seventy after the death of Joseph Smith. I think from that that it is altogether likely that he was a seventy before Joseph Smith's death, but still I do not know it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>398</questionnumber>
  <question>As such an officer he had a right to raise up that church or branch, did he not aside from any authority that he might have received from Strang? Would not that be true Mr Briggs?</question>
  <answer>Well he was an elder in the original church, - there is no manner of question about that, and that would give him the right. Now I say he was an elder in the original church, but whether joining with Strang in validated that eldership that is a question to be determined I suppose if possible, but I will say that at the re organization and at no time since as far as my knowledge goes have we understood that it did.</answer>

    </pagenumber>that he was only acknowledging Strang as simply the leader of the church for a short time, and until he found out his pretentions and claims, then he rejected him?
  </question>
  <answer>I do not understand that question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>400</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you not know that Gurley simply acknowledged Strang as his leader and the church for a time and that when he found out his pretentions to be the leader of the church during his life, that then Gurley rejected him and his leadership?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>401</questionnumber>
  <question>And was that not also true of William Smith?</question>
  <answer>How is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>402</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if that was not also the fact with reference to William Smith?</question>
  <answer>In what respect?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>403</questionnumber>
  <question>That you simply looked and accepted his claim for a short time, and that then when you found out what his pretentions were, and that they were false, you repudiated him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>404</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the way it was in your case?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>405</questionnumber>
  <question>And it was so in the case of the others was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I so understood it to be. I suppose that is the case, but of course I cannot speak positively only with reference to what happened in my own experience.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>406</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not understand that your authority to build up the church there was derived from William Smith did you?</question>
  <answer>At what time?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>407</questionnumber>
  <question>At any time, - when you belonged to his organization or at any other time?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>408</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you now if it is not a fact, that so far as the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1844 was not split to pieces was it not as a body and divided into numerous factions?</question>
  <answer>At what time?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>409</questionnumber>
  <question>At the time that you belonged to Strangs faction or organization, and also at the time that you belonged to William Smith's organization?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>410</questionnumber>
  <question>That was after 1844 that the church split up into these different factions?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>411</questionnumber>
  <question>This people with whom you were associated up there, were a people who were contending for the original doctrines of the church? Is that not a fact, that they were constantly contending for a maintanance of the original doctrines of the church in their purity?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>412</questionnumber>
  <question>Now when you say that you withdrew from Brigham Young and these others, you mean simply that you repudiated them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>413</questionnumber>
  <question>You repudiated their claim to rule the church as false, and their system and doctrine as heretical, and false?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I repudiated their claims to the Presidency as false, and that they were not entitled to govern the church, and on the ground that they were teaching false doctrines, and something that the church did not authorize.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>414</questionnumber>
  <question>When you say that you withdrew you mean that you just repudiated them?</question>
  <answer>That is all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>415</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not mean to say that you withdrew from the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not from the true church, but I refused to have anything to do with the church as represented by them, - that is by Brigham Young and his adherents.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>416</questionnumber>
  <question>And further you were claiming all the time that you were following the church in succession from 1830, - or were following what represented the church in 1830, - did you not so claim the fact to be?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>417</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what you claimed, - that the church was the church in succession established in 1830?</question>
  <answer>Well undoubtedly we did. I did I know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>418</questionnumber>
  <question>You still claimed that you belonged to that church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I did I know, although we were under different leaders we still claimed what we belonged to the original church, and as soon as we learned that any of our leaders were teaching false doctrine that was not taught in the original church we left it, and that was the reason we left Strang and Smith, because we considered that they were teaching false doctrine or doctrines that were not authorized in the original church. It did not make any difference to us, for we still considered that we were in the church although under these different leaders.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>419</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now I will ask you in reference to this new movement, - did you consider that was a new movement in the way of organizing a new church was concerned, or was it simply a new movement in the way of more perfectly and actively organizing the scattered branches of the original church in a new organization, which now organization was in succession from the original?</question>
  <answer>Well I cannot say for I never called it the new church or the new movement or anything of that kind.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>420</questionnumber>
  <question>It could not be properly called that?</question>
  <answer>What, - a new movement or organization?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>421</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>No sir it could not be properly called that, for that would mean a new organization of a church, which this was not, at least I never considered it so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>422</questionnumber>
  <question>Neither did the church as an organization?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was always contending and believed that it was the original church in succession, - that was what we believed at the time that organization was effected.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>423</questionnumber>
  <question>That was your individual opinion, and that was also the attitude of the church as an organization?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>424</questionnumber>
  <question>The church was simply reorganized and placed on a new footing as was necessary after the disruption?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>425</questionnumber>
  <question>And you were one of the principle officers in it at that time?</question>
  <answer>Well I stated what I was. I stated that I was one of the seven that were chosen.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>426</questionnumber>
  <question>Now at the time of the reading of a paper, - of a paper as you say in the priesthood lodge, at which time, C.F. Stiles, E.R. Briggs and William W. Blair and yourself were present, - is that all that were present?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I was asked to give the names of the ones who were present at that time, and who are now living and these are the names that I gave of the ones that were there who are now alive, but there were a great many others there who are now dead you know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>427</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did these parties whom you have named as being present, including W.W. Blair, - did they accept that doctrine of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I could name John Harrington as another one that was present, and Henry Long.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>428</questionnumber>
  <question>Well we do not care about that for they are not living, - are they living?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I think not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>429</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if they are dead we don't care about them?</question>
  <answer>Well these names I have given you are all living, - that is they all living as far as I know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>430</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember the word "polygamy" was used in that paper?</question>

  </pagenumber>
  <answer>What paper?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>431</questionnumber>
  <question>The paper that was read as you said at the meeting of that priesthood lodge?</question>
  <answer>I don't know whether it was or not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>432</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see that paper?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I saw it when it was read to us.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>433</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever have a copy of that paper, -that paper that was read to you there that contained the alleged revelation?</question>
  <answer>No sir I never had a copy of it at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>434</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you know any body who ever did have a copy of it?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't know anything about that. I don't know that there ever was a copy of it made or taken. I know I have no recollection of ever seeing it but that one time, and I don't know that it was ever copied.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>435</questionnumber>
  <question>These parties whom you have named as being present, you do not name them for the purpose of showing that they accepted that revelation, do you Mr. Briggs?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that is not my object at all. I simply name them because I was asked to name who were present and I have given the names of the ones that I recollect as being there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>436</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did these parties whom you have named, or any of them, to your knowledge ever accept the doctrine of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>No sir not that I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>437</questionnumber>
  <question>They did not accept it then?</question>
  <answer>No sir, unless sitting there and listening to it being read could be called an acceptance of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>438</questionnumber>
  <question>Well they did not accept it to your knowledge?</question>
  <answer>No sir, unless being there could be called accepting it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>439</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did they accept it, -did they pass upon it, and accept it themselves?</question>
  <answer>Not that I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>440</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it passed upon?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was not passed upon.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>441</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you accept the doctrine of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>It was not passed upon and consequently there was no acceptance to it at all. I know as I have stated that I did not accept it at all, and I don't think the rest did. At any rate that did not do so at that time. It was simply read to us there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>442</questionnumber>
  <question>So you do not mention W. W. Blair's name here, as being connected with the doctrine of polygamy so far as the practice and belief of it is concerned?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I simply mention him as being one that was present and heard it read with the rest of us.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>443</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know that it is a fact that the reading of certain things there was the occasion of your repudiating of William Smith, and the occasion of these other men repudiating him too?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that was the sole reason.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>444</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you know do you not that it was one of the things?</question>
  <answer>It was the occasion of my being in trouble and was the cause of my cutting loose I presume, but what influenced the rest or all of the rest who repudiated him afterwards I do not know of my own knowledge. I presume that that had something to do with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>445</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is all there is on that point? Now you were asked with reference to whether or not the reorganized church ever had a patriarch?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>446</questionnumber>
  <question>Now is it not a fact that the same laws were accepted for the government of the reorganization, that were in the original church? Is that not the fact Mr. Briggs?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is the fact, -at all events we so understood it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>447</questionnumber>
  <question>
    And those laws related equally to the reorganization as they
    <pagenumber>
      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0002_f0003-Pages_564-623-ORIGINAL/55.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 611</a>
    </pagenumber>did to the original church?
  </question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>448</questionnumber>
  <question>These laws I say applied to the reorganization, equally with the reorganized church?</question>
  <answer>We so understood it sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>449</questionnumber>
  <question>And if there was no patriarch or no baptism for the dead, there was a reason for it was there not?</question>
  <answer>Well I suppose so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>450</questionnumber>
  <question>If they did not have the ordinance of baptism for the dead or a patriarch, there was a reason for it was there not?</question>
  <answer>Well there must be a reason of course. Of course there was no patriarch in the re-organized church and no baptism for the dead that I ever heard of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>451</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state if the practice of baptism for the dead was stopped at Nauvoo prior to 1844, and during the life of the prophet?</question>
  <answer>Was it taught did you say?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>452</questionnumber>
  <question>No, was not the practice of it stopped during his life time, - - that is was it not stopped until proper preparation had been made for its performance in a proper manner?</question>
  <answer>Well I do not know that. I only know that it was practiced in 1848, but how long it was continued after that I do not know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>453</questionnumber>
  <question>If the records show that there was a command, or statement of the First Presidency prohibiting it for certain reasons, until a certain time, why that would be correct would it not Mr Briggs?</question>
  <answer>yes sir, I recollect that there was a statement of that kind, but whether it was stopped I do not know anything about that for I was not there. I was not there after September 1843, and it was practiced then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>454</questionnumber>
  <question>You say at the conference of 1853 I believe that there were certain parties, namely seven, set apart for the office of apostles who were ordained in that office and position under and by virtue of the authority of a revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>455</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the way they were selected and ordained?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>456</questionnumber>
  <question>The authority of the ordination there, would be the first the revelation would it not, - that would be the prime authority would it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we so understand it at all events.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>457</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe you stated that you met Granville Hedrick at that conference?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>458</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you did not meet him at that conference?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>459</questionnumber>
  <question>What conference was it that you did meet him at?</question>
  <answer>It was subsequently, - I can't fix the date, but it was subsequent to that date? It was some time after that conference.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>460</questionnumber>
  <question>Well he was in the conference?</question>
  <answer>How is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>461</questionnumber>
  <question>He was there in your conference?</question>
  <answer>He was at one conference. I recollect his being at one conference, but it was not at this one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>462</questionnumber>
  <question>You are sure it was not at this conference we refer to?</question>
  <answer>My memory is that it was not at that conference. Now that is my recollection about it, and I am quite positive that it is correct.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>463</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he not in fact at more than one conference?</question>
  <answer>I am not aware that he was, - still he might have been. Yes sir he was, I recollect now that he was at the last conference I attended that year, - that is the conference at Amboy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>464</questionnumber>
  <question>As a matter of fact he was at two conferences?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>465</questionnumber>
  <question>In that first conference, he took part in the proceedings?</question>
  <answer>I am not aware that he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>466</questionnumber>
  <question>You would not say whether he did or did not?</question>
  <answer>
    Well I would not say, for there were people there that were not identified with us that took part in the conference in the way of doing some talking
    <pagenumber>
      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0002_f0003-Pages_564-623-ORIGINAL/56.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 612</a>
    </pagenumber>that were not members of the conference, and what they said was simply by courtesy of the conference. There were persons there that were not identified with us that did some talking, but I do not think they did any voting. I know that Granville Hedrick never became a member of the church at all. I think however that he had something to say there at that conference although he did not belong to the church.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>467</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know whether he voted or not?</question>
  <answer>N0 sir He was never accounted a member of the reorganization, - I know that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>468</questionnumber>
  <question>And he was never accounted a member of that local church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>469</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not pass resolutions at that conference to this effect, declaring that all members of the original church, baptized curing the life of Joseph Smith, by proper authority, were proper members of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I think we did for so we held the fact to be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>470</questionnumber>
  <question>And those who were appointed elders of the church in the original church could properly take part with you? Is that not the fact</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we so held it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>471</questionnumber>
  <question>You could not have held any other way could you?</question>
  <answer>No sir I could not. That seems to-me to be the logical conclusion, - that all who were leaglly ordained to office in the original church, or who were members of the old church could legally be members of the reorganization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>472</questionnumber>
  <question>Then if Granville Hedrick was a member of the original church, he could take part with you, and legally also?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir he could but I do not understand that he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>473</questionnumber>
  <question>Well suppose that the record of the conference does show that, then what do you say?</question>
  <answer>The records shows that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>474</questionnumber>
  <question>That Granville Hedrick did take part in the proceedings of the conference, - if the record shows that, then what have you to say?</question>
  <answer>Well my memory as I have stated is that he had something to say there, and that what he said was simply talk that he indulged in at the courtesy of the conference, and that he never did take part with us as a member of the conference. He never did take part with us as a member, - that I know, for he objected to a cardinal principle that we held to.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>475</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was there not a great many objections raised there concerning a great many principles?</question>
  <answer>Well there was no serious objection, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>476</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you did not agree on all points did you, - you did not all agree on all points?</question>
  <answer>No sir not on all minor points, but we did on those fundamental principles. There was no objection to any of the fundamental principles that I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>477</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now as far as Granville Hedrick is concerned, he believed in the bible didn't he?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>478</questionnumber>
  <question>And in the book of Mormon?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>479</questionnumber>
  <question>And in the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>He did to a certain extent.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>480</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he not accept the book of doctrine and Covenants as published by the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, - now wholly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>481</questionnumber>
  <question>You have seen his work?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir".</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>482</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you seen his work entitled "The Spiritual wife System proven false, and the true order of church Discipline"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>483</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you read it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I have read it.</answer>
  <pagenumber>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>484</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you not know that that work sets out the fact that the book doctrine and covenants, as published during the life time of Joseph Smith as being one of the fundamental works of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think so, but still my memory is that he did not accept it wholly. Now that is my recollection of it, for I am pretty positive that he did not accept it wholly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>485</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was not this action in refusing to accept it wholly a subsequent act of his, - did not that action of his come out after the year 1860 more plainly?</question>
  <answer>Well now I will answer that by saying that I labored personally with Granville Hedrick at both of those conferences, and we could not, - he would not be made to see it as I saw it, and as I understood the church saw it, - that is in reference to the matter, and consequently he would not act with us. That was the trouble at that time, - that he would not see it as we saw it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>486</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then I will read you a paragraph from "Exhibit "W", on page fourteen, beginning at the words "now then", and ending with the word "Gentile", as follows, - "Now then, that Zion or the church is not delivered or established in peace, neither clothed upon the righteousness; but is in disgrace by her own members, and in bondage of one another, and of the world; and divided, that is, the church, since the death of Joseph has been rent in many divisions under different heads, or parties, being led by the cunning devices of such men as Strang, Brewster, Bishop, Banemy, Wm Smith and Brigham Young; in all six prominent parties, besides some other minor ones not necessary to name, thus has the church strangely deversified and distractedly wandered since the days of Joseph; Brethren you all remember that the book for Doctrine and Covenants says that Joseph was called to lay the foundation of a great work. Is this the work, that great work that Joseph was called to lay the foundation of so many false doctrines; did Joseph law the foundation for any of them? Joseph laid but the one foundation; now as there cannot be six or more different doctrines, all in, or on the same foundation, and all built up differently, or in different ways, and be just right. Joseph Smith was called to lay the foundation of a great work. How did he accomplish it? He translated the book of Mormon by the gift of power of God. In it comes forth the gospel to a nation of people once on this continent described to be the descendants of Joseph of Egypt. This book - then contains the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles" etc. Now was this not the doctrine of the re-organized church at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, substantially.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>487</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will read again from page nineteen of the same exhibit, - "and that the Church of Jesus Christ being established again anew, upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets of the Son of God on the 6th day of April A.D. 1830, embracing the doctrine contained in the bible, book of Mormon and book of Doctrine and Covenants, for their faith and practice. These three above named inspired volumes was received by the whole church of Christ, as established anew again by Joseph Smith, to be the rock and pillar, and ground work of their faith and doctrine in Christ Jesus, in the first days and years of this the identical church of Jesus Christ; hence we have the foundation of this church before us, of which I profess to be a member". Was not this the position of the reorganization as that time, or the church you had met with in conference there?</question>
  <answer>Substantially it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>488</questionnumber>
  <question>You recognize what I have read as a part of that book published by Granville Hedrick, do you not?</question>
  <answer>
    I do not remember now. I know that I read that book at the time that it was published or shortly afterwards.

    </pagenumber>Well I can't say that I read it or remember anything particularly that was in it, or the particular leaves that anything is on, as I did not own it, and only had it for a little while and glanced through it rather than read it. I only borrowed it as I did not own it. Defendants objects to any and all evidence, or extracts introduced as evidence, or for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of the witness, from Exhibit "W", on the ground that it simply purports to be an expression of Granville Hedrick's individual opinion, and he did not have authority to speak for either of the parties to this action, therefore it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>489</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you stated in your examination in chief that you had not known the time in the reorganized church, when there was a full quorom of Twelve, and some other quoroms; and now I will ask you if the laws of the church do not provide that all quoroms shall have different grades of officers?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, the law provides for it? Is that what you want to know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>490</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>Why certainly. I so understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>491</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the reason for not having these quoroms full has not been on account of any disagreements between the doctrine of the reorganized church, and the original church?</question>
  <answer>I do not quite comprehend the scope of your question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>492</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if it is not a fact that the reason that these quoroms has not been full, is not on account of any disagreement of doctrine between the re-organized church and the original church?</question>
  <answer>Of course not. I would not think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>493</questionnumber>
  <question>It is simply on account of the fact the officers are to be called in a proper way, and other have not been pointed out - that is the fact in that connection is it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - expediency has been the governing rule or principle in that regard as I understand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>494</questionnumber>
  <question>And not anything that would show or indicate a difference or distinction in the doctrine and belief of the reorganization as compared with the original church? Is that not it Mr Briggs?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't understand it that way at all. I do not understand that to be the case.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>495</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you spoke of baptism for health?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>496</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that a prominent feature of the doctrine of the original church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints any more than it is of the Re-organized church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints, if you know?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never considered that it was considered essential, - it was simply permissive. It was simply permissable, but I never knew of its being practiced ig the reorganized church, at all. Now I do not say that it never was practiced in the reorganized church, but to my recollection I never knew of its being practiced.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>497</questionnumber>
  <question>And so far as it being a doctrine is concerned, you would not say that it was a doctrine obligatory or permisive in the old organization?</question>
  <answer>My understanding is that it was taught as a doctrine that is benificial, and was practiced at the will of the persons interested, but was not obligatory, - it was simply taught as a doctrine that was benificial. That is about all that I knew about it, for I never head an elder or any body else preach it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>498</questionnumber>
  <question>That is in the old organization?</question>
  <answer>
    No sir. No where. I have never heard it taught as a present duty, but I have heard it taught.

  <question>Do you know whether Gurley's name was recorded on the record of Strang's church?</question>
  <answer>Zenas H. Gurley?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>500</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>On what record did you say?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>501</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if you knew whether or not Zenas H. Gurley's name was ever recorded on the records of the Strang's church as a member of that organization?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>502</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know whether it was or not?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>503</questionnumber>
  <question>Personally you do not know whether his name was ever recorded on the list of the members of adherents of Strang's church or organization, do you?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't know anything about it. If it was there I know I never authorized it to be put there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>504</questionnumber>
  <question>Was not your relationship with Strang caused simply from the fact that at that time he was the best light you recognized in the church, and for that reason you joined his organization?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and that is the way I stated the fact to be. That was the reason I was with him, and I said that as soon as I saw that he was preaching doctrine that was contrary to what I considered and knew to be the true doctrine of the church that I left him at once. I considered that he was the head of the church,- the successor of Joseph Smith (handwritten in: writing of) that letter of appointment.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>505</questionnumber>
  <question>You accepted him at first and after-wards you found out that you were mistaking?</question>
  <answer>Well I thought I was mistaken at all events or should not have renounced his leadership.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>506</questionnumber>
  <question>And so it was with reference to you connection with William Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I certainly did renounce that as soon as I found out that they were preaching and teaching doctrine that was as I viewed it, contrary to the doctrine as taught in the original church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>507</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you also stated that there had been some revelations given by or through the present President of the reorganized church of Jesus Christ of Latter Da Saints, that had never been presented to the quorums?</question>
  <answer>Not to my knowledge. They were not presented to my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>508</questionnumber>
  <question>You cannot say however that they were never presented to the quorums?</question>
  <answer>No sir I could not say that they never were,-I can only say that they were never presented to my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>509</questionnumber>
  <question>Was the doctrine of the original church, and the doctrine of reorganization the same so far as belief in the fact,-that the bible,-the King James translation of the bible was not a perfect translation, and there ought to be another?</question>
  <answer>Of course that was taught.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>510</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it not the President of the original church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints that translated the Bible, and that is the Holy Scriptures you referred to in your examination in chief?</question>
  <answer>It is so understood that Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon translated it and corrected it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>511</questionnumber>
  <question>And if the reorganized church also recognized that as a standard authority in the church also, do you understand that that would be changing their policy or doctrine from that of the original church?</question>
  <answer>Oh no, as a matter of course it wouldn't.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>512</questionnumber>
  <question>That would not in your opinion constitute a change of doctrine or policy from that of the original church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>513</questionnumber>
  <question>Does not the reorganized church recognize the King James translation of the bible also?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>514</questionnumber>
  <question>It not only recognizes it but it uses it in the services does it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it is recognized by the church and used by its elders. There is no question about that. I think I have already clearly stated that, for I stated that at the outset of my examination that at the time of the conference at which the organization was effected, or put on foot, we then declared at the very outset, that we accepted the bible, the book of Mormon and the book of Doctrine and Covenants as the law for the guidance of the church, and of course the bible that we accepted was the King James translation for we did not have any other at that time. That is the translation of the bible that we meant in our acceptance of the bible as one of the books of doctrine.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>515</questionnumber>
  <question>You refer to the King James translation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>516</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not the policy of the church, and has it not always been that the elders could use any and every translation?</question>
  <answer>I understand that they have that priveledge. I have never been required to use any other translation, - I mean to say that I have never been required to use any other translation that I am aware of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>517</questionnumber>
  <question>You have not been required to use any one translation to the exclusion of the others, either, have you</question>
  <answer>No sir, not that I am aware of. I have never been required to do so I know, and I don't know that I have ever heard of any one else who was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>518</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you stated that it was Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon who translated and corrected that, - that is the new version?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that is my understanding of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>519</questionnumber>
  <question>Now was it not Oliver Cowdery?</question>
  <answer>I understood that it was Sidney Rigdon.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>520</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you understand of your own personal knowledge who it was?</question>
  <answer>I only know from the records, and the book of Doctrine and Covenants shows that it was Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon who were appointed to do the work, for the original church established in 1830.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>521</questionnumber>
  <question>Which body's work was it in reality, - was it the work of the original church established in 1830 or was it the work of the reorganized church, - I refer to the translating of the scriptures, - was it the original church established in 1830 or was it the work of the reorganization?</question>
  <answer>It was the work of Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon who were members of the original church, that is they were members of the original church organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>522</questionnumber>
  <question>And Presidents of the original church, too, were they not?</question>
  <answer>Well they belonged to the first Presidency, - Joseph Smith was the President, and Sidney Rigdon was his counsellor as I understood it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>523</questionnumber>
  <question>And was not the revelation commanding that, accepted as authoritive by the original church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir of course, I think it is the first edition of the book or doctrine and Covenants, and that was accepted by the General Sssembly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>524</questionnumber>
  <question>You stated that when you were with William Smith at first the claim was made, that the seed of Joseph would eventually come forth?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>525</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the statement that was made?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>526</questionnumber>

    I will ask you if it was not really the belief of all such

    </pagenumber>Latter Day Saints,-all bodies of the Latter Day Saints, to a certain degree, so far as your knowledge goes or extended that the seed of Joseph Smith was the proper person to occupy their fathers place in time?
  </question>
  <answer>At what time?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>527</questionnumber>
  <question>After the death of Joseph Smith and up to the time that the present President of the re-organized church came forward and took his place at the head of the church,-was it not during that time the belief,-the all most universal belief, that the seed of Joseph were the proper one to occupy their fathers place?</question>
  <answer>Well there an element of that kind that always was present to a greater or lesser degree amongst all the Saints that I had anything to do with.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>528</questionnumber>
  <question>And that element predominated did it not in all the branches or churches that were represented in that conference that you have spoken of? That is the conference of 1852,-was not that element the dominant element in all the different branches or factions that had representation there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>529</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the idea that they held to?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they-were specifically planted on that idea.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>530</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the dominant idea in relation to whom was entitled to be at the head of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>531</questionnumber>
  <question>And that idea had been with the members of the church from the very time of the death of Joseph down to that time, had it not?</question>
  <answer>Oh, undoubtedly it had been with a great many.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>532</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you referred you say, to the fact of hearing some talk or gossip in Nauvoo, about a revelation on plural marriage?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I have heard it talked about.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>533</questionnumber>
  <question>You would not pretend to identify that the polygamous revelation afterwards published by Brigham Young?</question>
  <answer>How is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>534</questionnumber>
  <question>You would not undertake to identify that revelation that you heard gossip about there at Nauvoo, with the polygamous revelation afterwards published by Brigham Young at Salt Lake City?</question>
  <answer>No sir of course I could not pretend to do anything of that kind, because there were no particulars given me about it, and as I did not see it or hear it read, I cannot say anything about that. Of course I don't pretend, and do not say, that they were the same. None of the particulars in regard to it were given to me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>535</questionnumber>
  <question>You simply heard chats on the streets and in private?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>536</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the way you heard of it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>537</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not hear polygamy taught from the stand did you, or from the pulpit?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>538</questionnumber>
  <question>And you did not hear it taught in public at all?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not at all. It was simply rumor that I heard-that was all. I never heard anything taught about it publicly from the stand or in any other way. What I heard was from individuals in their own houses-elders and members of the church, and the like.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>539</questionnumber>
  <question>Well they did not teach polygamy did they?</question>
  <answer>Polygamy was never named at all,-it was sealing what they called it, and did not say anything about polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>540</questionnumber>
  <question>Sealing was what you heard talked about?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>541</questionnumber>
  <question>It was sealing for eternity?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir sealing for eternity,-sealing for time, and for eternity also.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>542</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you see the paper that claimed to be the revelation at that time?</question>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>548</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not see the revelation and was not told anything about its contents specifically, but I heard it in a general way as a rumor more than anything else, a rumor that there was such a revelation in existence.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>544</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you did not see the revelation at that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not at that time, nor at any other time since then. I never saw it at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>545</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know where or not your brother Silas Briggs was ever connected with any of the factions that were formed out of the church, prior to his uniting with the church, or the conference that culminated in that reorganization?</question>
  <answer>Well he acted with the twelve that was formed under the leadership of James J. Strang, and he accepted in some sense or in some degree the leadership of James J. Strang, but he could not be really called an active member of that organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>546</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he ever a member in reality?</question>
  <answer>Well I really do not know where he was or not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>547</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was he a member of the individuals who accepted Strang?</question>
  <answer>Well I know that he was accounted as one who accepted the leadership of James J. Strang. I know he was there at different times and of course it could be said that we was a member of that organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>548</questionnumber>
  <question>In order to refresh your recollection regarding this matter, I will call your attention to the testimony of Elder E.C. Briggs given in this case, in which he stated that his brother Silas (who would be your brother of course) was never identified as a member with them, now in the face of that statement would you say that he was?</question>
  <answer>I haven't said that he was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>549</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I understood you to say that he was?</question>
  <answer>You have misunderstood me, for I did not state that he ever formally united with Strang. He acted I think with the body that he represented, but I do not know that he ever formally united with that organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>550</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then you cannot stated, that all of these parties that took part in that conference had been connected with some other branch of the church?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say. I have not stated that all of them did. If I did, and I have no recollection of doing so, I did not mean to make the statement in that way, but I will say now that while I do not know that such was the fact, yet I do not know of an exception. There may be an exception, but if there is I do not know of any.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>551</questionnumber>
  <question>And these parties that you mention as having taken part, you do not know or understand that they had left the original church at all, or any of them?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I simply gave them the same credit that I asked for, that is the credit of good intentions. I do not know I said of any that had not joined some of these different organizations, and in joined them I expect they each at the time believed it was the church all the time, that is that each of them at the time believed it was the true church they were joining, and that they were in the church all the time I cannot say of course as to the secret motives in their breast that impelled them to join these factions or organizations, but I know that in my action in doing so I thought it was the church that I joined, else I should not have joined them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>552</questionnumber>
  <question>
    They were simply members of the original church, and were looking for the proper leader of the church?

    </pagenumber>Is that not the fact Mr Briggs?
  </question>
  <answer>I suppose so. As I said before I cannot say as to the secret motives that impelled them, but I know as to the "Strangites". I for one believed for a time that we had the true leader, and when I satisfied myself that I was mistaken I left him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>553</questionnumber>
  <question>All these parties had been leaders. - I mean that had been members of the original church, and after the death of Joseph Smith they were looking for the proper leader of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is the way I understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>554</questionnumber>
  <question>And you thought that you had found the true leader in Mr Strang?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>555</questionnumber>
  <question>And as soon as you found out it was not Mr Strang, then you repudiated Strang?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>556</questionnumber>
  <question>And you did not understand that you left the original church when you left Strang?</question>
  <answer>No sir I do not understand it that way, and never did.</answer>
  <mono>Re-direct examination by Mr Hall, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>557</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state Mr Braggs, if after you left the reorganized church, you found out, - or at the time you left it, you found out that you had made the same mistake with regarr to young Joseph Smith being the leader of the church, that you had made with regard to Strang being the leader, and these other men being the leader?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper re-direct examination, and call for an opinion of the witness only.</mono>

  <question>You may answer the question?</question>
  <answer>What is the question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>559</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if you were mistaken, - I will ask you to state whether or not you found out that you were mistaken in regard to what you found out in regard to the claims of, young Joseph Smith, the present President of the reorganized church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, - whether or not you made the same mistake as you afterwards found out in regard to his being the true leader or head of the church, that you had made in the case of Strang?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds set forth in the preceeding objection.</mono>
  <answer>Do you want me to answer that question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>560</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well if it is necessary for me to answer it I could do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>561</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you decline to answer that question?</question>
  <answer>Well that is a question that I could answer yes or no. I cannot answer it either yes, or no, and do myself justice, or you justice, but I can answer it if I have to.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>562</questionnumber>
  <question>Well just answer it in your own way?</question>
  <answer>I have already state substantially why I withdrew from the reorganized church. I have already stated that, and now I do not conceive that it is necessary for me to state that there were other reasons, for there my be other reasons besides that, but not questions or reasons necessarily involving the Presidency, for that is a matter that did not figure in reference to my withdrawal from the church, - that point did not figure at all when I withdrew.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>563</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state whether or not you still consider yourself to be a member of rhe church?</question>
  <answer>In what way?</answer>

  <questionnumber>564</questionnumber>
  <question>Well in any way? Do you still consider yourself a member of the church in the same sense that you considered yourself to be a member of the church when you repudiated Strang's organization or William Smith's organization?</question>
  <answer>Do I still consider myself a member of the original church? Is that your question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>565</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, a member of the original church in the same sense that you considered yourself a member of the original church at the time that you left Strang's organization or William Smith's organization?</question>
  <answer>I do not know how to answer that question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>566</questionnumber>
  <question>I mean a member of the original church that you joined in 1841?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and calls for an expression of opinion by the witness.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>567</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question Mr. Briggs?</question>
  <answer>Well no I do not for I have decided in my own mind that I am not a member of the church. I will state to relieve this complication that I do not now consider myself a member of any church at the present time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>568</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state, as you were asked the question in your cross examination. I will ask you to state where or not W.W. Blair, whether you know that he remained a member of William Smith's church after this revelation had been presented at the meeting regarding which you spoke, at which he was present, and where it was read, concerning the plurality of wives?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it is my understanding that he did remain for some time. I know that after I left William Smith's organization I received a letter from him rebuking me for the step I had taken, and consequently I infer that he was then in William Smith's church. For he wrote in the interest of William Smith and he scarcely would have done that had he not been in his church. I received that letter some time after I had left William's church or organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>569</questionnumber>
  <question>And subsequent also to these meetings that you have referred to, this meeting where the revelation on plurality of wives was read?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir of course it was subsequent to that?</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the questions asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that it is not re-direct examination, and immaterial, and to the answer of the witness on the same grounds, and moves the court to exclude it from the record for that reason.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>570</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state whether or not this letter that was written to you was in regard to rejecting this revelation of William Smith's on plural marriage.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and does not call for the best evidence, the letter itself being the best evidence, and counsel for the plaintiff demand that the letter itself be introduced before the witness is interrogated about it.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>571</questionnumber>
  <question>You may answer the question?</question>
  <answer>Well now I am not aware, and do not think, in fact I am quite sure that none of his letters ever referred to that particular document. That is to that revelation. I was rebuked not for the rejection of that, or the slighting of it, but for rejecting William Smith. That was the subject of his complaint, and what he objected to, the rejection of William Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>572</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Now you were asked in your cross examination, if there was not a resolution passed, recognizing, or urging the members of the church

  <answer>Yes sir</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>573</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you whether or not the church or that gathering there, could by resolution make people mem- bers of that organization that was effected there in 1853 without their consent?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>574</questionnumber>
  <question>A resolution could not do - that?</question>
  <answer>No - sir, we never held to the idea that we could hold or claim a member against his will. That was an idea that I never heard advanced in the church at the time or since; but we did hold then and all the time since while I was a member of the church, that all who were eligible could come in, and all the members duly baptized by proper authority in the old church could come into the reorganization if they had not departed the faith and then they could come in by being re-baptized, but all old members who has remained staedfast in the faith, could come into the reorganization on their original baptism.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>575</questionnumber>
  <question>Provided they would not make application?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir of course.</answer>

  <question>I asked you to state if it is not a fact that the law of the old church and its practice in regarding to the filling of quoroms in the church, and the prac- tice of the reorganized church in the same regard is not different, - that is if the law and practice of the reorganized church in that regard is not different from the practice and law of the old church?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not say as to that only from what I I have learned from the records of the old church, or the first organization. I always understood that there was a similarity, but I suppose there was a difference in some respects, and I presume there was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>579</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you, in-as-much as that question has been asked you on cross examination, to state whether or not, - if there was a law requiring baptism by imersion for the remission of sins in the old church, and that was practiced in the old church, but there was a law in the reorganized church requir ing baptism by imersion for the remission of sins, but that was not practiced in the reorganized church whether the reorganized church would be the same in doctrine and practice as the old church was?</question>

    </pagenumber>have Twelve apostles, and they do not have twelve apostles, and never have had twelve apostles, whether the practice of the reorganized church is the same in the regard as it, - was the practice of the original church?
  </question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that i is "presuming a doctrine to be the practice of the original church, which is not true and not correct, according to-the records, and the question is there for incompetent, and irrelevant".</mono>
  <answer>I understand and have always understood and the reorganized church has always understood so far as my knowledge goes up to the time that I ceased to be a member of it, - on that point, - - that there is a law recognized by the church, by which a majority may form a quorom, for if that was not the practice it would sometimes be impossible to do any business. It is impossible that it should be other wise.</answer>

  <questionnumber>584</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state whether or not in this case there was a controversy to rise, - to arise, - regarding any doctrine, - whether or not the inspired translation of the bible would be taken as authority in preference to the King James translation of the bible?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, and immeterial to any of the issues in this case.</mono>
  <answer>I am not aware that it was ever used in that way. I don't know that it ever was. It is considered an authority and superior to the old translation by many, but I don't know that it was ever used that way and as no instance has ever come up in which that question was raised I cannot say what would be done.</answer>

  <question>The laws of the reorganized church upon that subject is just the same as it was in the original church, is it not?</question>

  <questionnumber>1</questionnumber>
  <question>Where do you live Mrs Eaton?</question>
  <answer>Where do I live now?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>2</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes madam?</question>
  <answer>Well on the corner of Temple and Walnut streets in Independence, Missouri.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>3</questionnumber>
  <question>How long have you lived here in Independence?</question>
  <answer>Fifteen years about.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>4</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did you live prior to coming to Independence to live?</question>
  <answer>In Illinois, in DeKalb County.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>5</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever live in Caldwell County, Missouri?</question>
  <answer>Well I believe it was Caldwell County. It was in DeWitt and I think that is in Caldwell County I stayed there for a while and then I was in Far West, Caldwell County?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>6</questionnumber>
  <question>Just state what time you lived in Far West, Caldwell County?</question>
  <answer>In 1838 I believe it was. I don't know that I can state the exact time that they left there but I lived there in '38.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>7</questionnumber>
  <question>You went up to Far West?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>8</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, what was the occasion of your going up to Far West?</question>
  <answer>Well it was designed to settle there. We went there with the design of settling and residing there permanently.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>9</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not in 1838 live at Far West, and right in the place?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not right in the town. We did not live right in the city at that time. I might say that I did not live in the place at all, for we lived about five miles from there I think. South of that place about five miles was the place I lived.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>10</questionnumber>
  <question>What time was that that you lived there?</question>
  <answer>That was the same year. We were only there one winter.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>11</questionnumber>
  <question>In what part of the year was it that you lived five miles south of Far West?</question>
  <answer>Well that was, - I believe we came there in April and located the place, but we moved there in November I think.</answer>

  <questionnumber>12</questionnumber>
  <question>How old were you at that time Mrs. Eaton?</question>
  <answer>Twenty one I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>13</questionnumber>
  <question>Ar that time you were twenty-one years of age?</question>
  <answer>I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>14</questionnumber>
  <question>Now at that time that you lived five miles south of Far West, just state what occasioned your leaving that place and going up to Far West, if any thing?</question>
  <answer>Well it was because a part of about forty men came to our house on horse back, - they came alongside of our yard, and came up barking like dogs, as near as they could imitate a dogs' bark, and they told us we must leave there, or we would smell thunder and lightning, - that was what they said; and then they asked for a drink of water and my mother got them the drink, and they said they were going to drive us into Far West. Neal Gillen was going into Far West, but he was going into it from the other side where they were going to drive us and they said they would give us hell, and we waited until it was a little dark and then we started for Far West.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>15</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they attempt anything else while they were there at your premises?</question>
  <answer>No sir, only they inquired if we had any arms in the house, and we said we had not and they made some remark that Mormons were liars, or something like that, - I don't just remember the remark that they made, - that is, the exact words they used, but it was to the effect that Mormons were liars and not be be believed, at any rate my mother said for them to come into the house, - not it was my father said for them to go in and search the house and see if there were any arms there, and they would not go in.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>16</questionnumber>
  <question>How were these men dressed, - was it in a white blanket coat that they were dressed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, some of them seemed to be dressed in what seemed to be a coat made from a white blanket or something of that kind. It was the style of the country at that time to have coats made out of white blankets, for the country was a new country, and that kind of material was the easiest obtained and so for that reason most of the men wore it. They were in the white blankets, and don't know but what it was customary at that time to wear a leather belt, and if you would observe a man in those days the chanced were that you would see his bowie knife stick in it, as they went hunting considerable in those days. This knife would be attached to the leather belt with a scabbard, but I did not notice it particularly to say if they had that on that time, but I think at least some of them did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>17</questionnumber>
  <question>What was their behaviour at that time?</question>
  <answer>Nothing further than to say about what I have stated, and to tell us to leave there as I have stated, and giving us that reason that we should leave or we would have to leave.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>18</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they go away peacably?</question>
  <answer>No sir, they went away as they came imitating the barking of a dog as nearly as they could, and making all the noise they could in that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>19</questionnumber>
  <question>They barked like dogs?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, as nearly as men could do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>20</questionnumber>
  <question>That occurred out at the place you lived about five miles south of Far West?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>21</questionnumber>
  <question>And from there you went to Far West?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we west as they ordered us to do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>22</questionnumber>
  <question>They ordered you to go to Far West, and in accordance with that order you went?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>23</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what happened up there at Far West?</question>
  <answer>
    Well, they surrounded us, - the prairies were black around Far West, you might say, and you could see men riding

      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0009-Pages_617-696-ORIGINAL/18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 631</a>
    </pagenumber>to and fro over the prairies all around Far West, and the prairies were literally black with them.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>24</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was done then?</question>
  <answer>Well they demanded that the Latter Day Saints surrender, and that they stack their arms, and they did it I think, - anyway that was the statement that I heard of it, for although I was there in Far West I did not see it. I can't tell much about what happened there at the time, for it was a time of such peril and confusion that I don't hardly know what was done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>25</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you leave Far West after that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>26</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did you go then?</question>
  <answer>We went back to the place again about five miles south of Far West.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>27</questionnumber>
  <question>You went out in the country again?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir we went to our place in the country.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>28</questionnumber>
  <question>How long was it before you could go back?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not tell, but it must have been three or four days. I am not certain whether it was a week or less than a week. I hardly think though that it was a week that we were there before we went back again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>29</questionnumber>
  <question>That was after the treaty had been made?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir and they had taken of what they termed "the author- ities" of the church. They took them away from the city, and then they gave us permission to go back to our homes again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>30</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there any conditions attached to that permission to return to your homes again?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they told us to leave the country in the spring, or before the spring if we saw fit, and to never attempt to put a plow in the ground again, but to leave in the spring, and that is what we agreed to do, and that is what we did do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the orders, that you were to leave the coun- try in the spring?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>32</questionnumber>
  <question>And not return to it any more?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That was the orders and general talk as I understood it. I did not hear these orders given but I don't think th there is any doubt but that is the order that was given, for we did all leave in the spring, and some went in the winter.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know whether that was the order of General Clarke at that time, or the generals that were there?</question>
  <answer>I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember any of them that were there? That is, any of the generals?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not see any of them, for I had retired in my tent, and only know what I heard from the general conversation that was going on there at the time. I did not see ahy of the generals that were in command there at the time that I know of, but I saw the men that were there all around the city on every side. I saw them frequently on horse-back in every direction, moving around to dif- ferent places.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>35</questionnumber>
  <question>Were there people there that were given any permis- sion to stay to your knowledge? I mean those termed Mormons?</question>
  <answer>No I think not. I think they were all ordered to leave in the spring. The common conver- sation was that they all had to leave and none should put a plow in the ground in the spring. They were not to cultivate their farms or think of staying there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>36</questionnumber>
  <question>Then they all did prepare themselves and leave the county, so far as your knowledge goes?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and the state, - I think they were to leave the state.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>37</questionnumber>
  <question>What time did you leave?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know what day in April it was that we left, but it was some time in the month of April after the grass was up about as it is now when we started. We waited until the grass was up pretty well so that we could feed our teams. I know my father owned a farm there and we had to leave that.</answer>

  <question>Have you any objection to stating whst the endowments received at Nauvoo were? Counsel for plaintiff objects to question asked the wit- on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination.</question>
  <answer>I don't know as it is anything that belongs to the church at the present time. I don't know that it belongs to the church at the present time in any way, and I never went through all their endowments there. My husband from what little he saw of it said it was the devil and so we rejected it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>240</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you never went through all of it?</question>
  <answer>no sir, not all of it, for my husband from what he saw of it did not believe in it, but said it was of the devil. That was after Joseph died.</answer>

  <questionnumber>243</questionnumber>
  <question>now have you ever seen anything in the re-organized church like the endowments you saw at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>No sir - never anything like it. I never saw anything other than the endowments spoken of in the bible when it says they spoke with tongues and prophesied. We do not pretend to anything different from that and don't permit or countenance anything else in any shape or manner. That is all the endowment I know of in the re-organized church and we do not permit anything else either.</answer>

  <question>I believe you stated madam that you never left Nauvoo until at the time of the breaking up of the church there?</question>
  <answer>Well I left there in 1846 and that was about the time of the breaking up of the church. I don't know either that I can say that it was the time of the breaking up of the church for they had not all left there at that time, - there was only a few of them had gone from there when I left there.</answer>

    </pagenumber>By Mr. Southern, - "That is object to for the reasons given if the objection to the introduction of the other extracts from the same book." The following is a true, accurate and correct copy of the extract offered in evidence above from Exhibit "W", beginning on page 90 and following pages, and ending on page 94 to wit, - "Let those who wish to do right and serve God according to the gospel plan of salvation, call their solemn assemblies, and in council determine to stand and build upon the things given in the things beginning of the church, as is contained in the BIBLE, BOOK OF MORMON, AND BOOK OF DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, WHICH WERE GIVEN FOR THE FOUNDATION AND STANDARD OF FAITH AND DOCTRINE FOR THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST, IN WHICH ALL THINGS ARE GIVEN THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS, AND REGULATE ALL THE AFFIARS OF THE SAME. In the book of doctrine and covenants is the order of the priesthood to the church of Jesus Christ, as given throuhg Joseph Smith, from heaven by the Lord himself, and that too, for the last time. The book of doctrine and covenants sets forth the order of priesthood to the church and poinst out the different offices, and also the character and qualifications of those upon whom the different offices shall be conferred, and likewise defines the duty of all the several officers, and also of the members. It also contains the covenants and church articles, and links together the BIBLE AND BOOK OF MORMON which contains the fullness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of the only true and living God. These three books then were given to the church of Jesus Christ (in these last days which was organized on the 6th day of April 1830, by Joseph Smith) for the foundation and standard of faith and doctrine for the people of God, to build themselves upon the most holy faith, once delivered to the saints. This church organization was founded on the principles of the doctrine as found in these three books of inspiration, and that the things written in those inspired volumes, when rightly observed, are wholly sufficient to govern and regulate all church matters and affairs, both great and small, with perfect accuracy, and that the church mest come to this standard before we can be delivered from the apostacy, and set aright, and become acceptable before the Lord. Now if any one should desire further proof in regard to the things given for a standard and foundation of this church, just turn and read the 28 to 33 pages of this work. There you will find proof positive, showing plainly that the doctrine contained in those three inspired volumes, were given to this church for a code of laws, to govern and regulate all matters and affair in this church whatever, and to be a standard for the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Hence, brethren, I presume we have it plain before us, relating to the subject of the foundation of this church, and I have also shown that the spiritual wife system is a departure from the standard of fait and doctrine upon which tis church was first founded and built up in; also that this departure is a heresy, and that those who are engaged in the practice of polygamy are in an awful wicked state of apostacy. That the principle authorities of this church are in a state of apostacy will appear plain to the mind of every man and woman who are convinced that the doctrine of polygamy is false and desperately wicked; and it must appear equally plain to the mind of every candid man or woman, that the church can never be re-established, and built up in the gospel purity while it is under the direction and influence of these apostate authorities. In this view of the subject, no doubt but that we all agree. But, says you, seeing this people are led off into abominable whoredoms, under the direction of men of talent and high authority in the church, and are still persisting in their 647 ity in this church, and are still persisting in their wicked practices, - seeing this state of things has unfotrtunately befallen the church, what shall we do, and how shall we behold the church set once more in its primitive order anf if we draw the lines of seperation, how shall we build up without authority? All such like questions have been presented by many, and not being able to solve such imaginary difficulties, they have suffered themselves to be led astray with the idea that some great man, with great and extraordinary claims of authority, will yet arise and set this church in order, and during this misguided state of mind, and anxious expectations of their hope to see some great man appear, and thus unguardedly they subject themselves to their imaginary views, having lost sight of the true order of things as is pointed out in the book of covenants, which if read and understood, would be a sufficient detector in each and every case that might arise. The spiritual wife system has been proved to be false, and the things constituting the foundation of this church have been plainly illustrated, and also that many of the authorities of this church are in a state of apostacy and that the necessity of the times calls loudly for a reform in this church. This then, brings me to the subject of authority or priesthood, to show who has the legal right to put forth their hands in renovating the building up the church in the gospel purity, as it was given to her in the beginning for a standard of doctrine and faith, and also the order in which it shall be accomplished."

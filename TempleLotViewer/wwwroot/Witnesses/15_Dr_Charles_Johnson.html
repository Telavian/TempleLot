  <mono>Depositions of witnesses taken in the above entitled cause on the 18th day of April 1892, beginning at 2 o'clock P.M., by agreement of the parties hereto, notice having been expressly waived, in the Grand Jury room in the court house in the city of Independence, Jackson County, Missouri, the parties hereto being represented personally and by counsel as is here-in-before, set forth, - By Mr Southern, - "Mr Notary I see by the record of the testimony that was taken at Salt Lake City, under the Comission by which you were authorized to act as an examiner for the purpose; that upon the beginning of the taking of testimony on behalf defendants, that the folowing order was made upon the application of the plaintiffs, asking for the rule in relation to the exclusion of witnesses from the room where the testimony was being taken on behalf of the defendants, either here or in Salt Lake City, or else-where where testimony may hereafter be taken on the part of the defendants. Now the defendant suggests that that rule cannot be enforced, or should not be enforced against one party, without against the other one as well. I assume that the object of the entry was to show that after that time the intention was to enforce the rule as against all the parties, or witness for both parties. By Mr E.L. Kelley, - "He asked to have it apply to all witnesses, - our as well as yours". Is that what you ask now Mr Southern"? By Mr Southern, - "Of course I do." By the Notary, - "Upon the commencement of the taking of testify the defendants in Salt Lake City, the plaintiffs asked for a rule excluding the defendants witnesses from the room, and the defendants counsel at once stated that if the rule was to be enforced against the witness for the defendant that he would ask that it also be enforced against the witnesses for the plaintiff, which was agreed to, and the agreement was entered into in my presence that no witness should be allowed to remain in the room while the testimony of any other witness was being taken, and they were so instructed, and counsels agreed that they would notify their witnesses and keep them out of the room." By Mr Kelley, - "That is just the way it was. Now let the record show that we consent to this rule in relation to our witnesses we do not desire that they should remain in the room, - although in this case we do not see that it makes any particular difference. Mr Briggs and Mr Nathan you will withdraw from the room. I would state though that we do not intend to use Mr Briggs upon any point that this witness now on the stand will testify to, and we would like it if you would permit him to remain in the room". by Mr Southern, - "We feel inclined to accomadate you Mr Briggs, and upon the statement of the counsels for the plaintiffs, the worthy bishop of the plaintiff church, we will permit you to remain in the room as we do not wish to dis-commode you unnecessarily. Dr Charles Johnson of lawful age being produced, sworn and examined on the part of the plaintiffs, testified as follows, - Direct examination by P.P. Kelley, -</mono>

  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you Dr Cowdery, - Dr Johnson I mean, if Oliver Cowdery is living now?</question>
  <answer>No sir I expect not. I believe I said he was dead but I don't know it for I did not see him die, and so I can't say that he is dead, but I expect that he is dead, for I understand that he died five years before I married his daughter. I understood that he had been dead about that time when were married.</answer>

  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>
  <question>You know of Oliver Cowdery's death simply by reason of conversations you have had with your wife and her mother, Oliver Cowdery's widow?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir and hundreds of her people. There is I suppose hundreds told me of his death, who knew he was dead. There was old David Whitmer, you might say, for he was a man that was very well thought of, and he told me that he was dead, and he was a man that had every bod's respect.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>He told you that Olivery Cowdery was dead?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>35</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you Dr Johnson if you were of the same religious faith as your wife and your mother-in law?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>36</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not belong to the same religious faith as they belonged to?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and I would be a better man if I had been, for I was not as good as they were.</answer>

  <answer>None at all.</answer>

  <question>What denomination, if any, did you belong to it any time during the life time or your wife?</question>
  <answer>Nono at all, and never did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>40</questionnumber>
  <question>That is all?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Cross-examination by Mr Southern, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>41</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Doctor you have been asked if you belonged to the same church that your wife, and your mother-in law belonged to?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>42</questionnumber>
  <question>And you say you did not belong to the same denomination they belonged to?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't belong to any church, and never did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>43</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't, and never did?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>44</questionnumber>
  <question>Now to what church did your wife and mother-in-law belong?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, not the best evidence, and not cross-examination.</mono>
  <answer>I can't tell you only from that they said, but then in the first place they belonged to what is called the Mormon church, but they left that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>45</questionnumber>
  <question>That at first belonged to the Mormon church you say, and they left it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is what I understood.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>46</questionnumber>
  <question>They left the Mormon Church?</question>
  <answer>I don't think when they died that they belonged to any church at all, but their belief I believe was with the Latter Day Saints. I don't know what you would call it for we did not talk much about it betwixt ourselves, for I let my wife believe as she had alike to and she did me the same and we got along all right, for we did not live by quarreling, or fighting, we lived peacably.</answer>

  <question>When was he there?</question>
  <answer>I can't tell you that exactly, but it was a year or two agao, - it has been some time ago, but I can't say exactly when it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>53</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about when was he at your place?</question>
  <answer>I say it was a year perhaps two years ago, but as I said I can't tell the time exactly only that it was two years ago - I think about that long ago. I don't recollect just what time it was, for I never paid much attention to it, only I think it was about two years ago. Maybe it wasn't quite that long ago.</answer>

  <answer>How?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>58</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the purpose of their meeting?</question>
  <answer>You sit up here and tell me what he says (speaking to Mr P.P. Kelley whom witness desires to repeat the questions to the witness, for the reason as the witness states he is deaf and cannot hear the question propounded by counsel for the defendant)</answer>
  <answer>I can't hear what you say?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>59</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will try and ask my questions so that you can hear them, and I don't want Mr Kelley to help you, - we can probably get along without him? I asked you what was the purpose of Mr Kelley's visit?</question>

  <answer>One man got a deed for one lot and he had to get an abstract for it, and when the abstract came it covered the hull thing you see, - that is the abstract covered all of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>81</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then listen to my question Doctor, - is this what you mean, - Is this what you mean, - that if the Re-organized church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or Mr Kelley the bishop of that organization, or any other agent of the reorganized church, should be able to recover the two acres of the ground that you quit claimed to them, known as the "temple lot", then you expect that will vindicate your title to the whole seventy acres?</question>

  <question>Was that a part of the consideration for the deed that you made to them?</question>
  <answer>He was just to go on and go through with it, but there was nothing said about that part of it, or anything further than that, but what steps he would take to recover this property would have a tendency to be in my favor you know. That is all I know about it.</answer>

  <question>Dr Johnson were you and your wife apprised of the fact that you had any title to the property of which you were asked to make a quit claim deed, and the other property referred to, before you saw Mr Kelley?</question>

  <questionnumber>95</questionnumber>
  <question>You knew of that before the time you were asked for this quit claim deed to the temple lot, or the piece of ground here that is referred to as the temple lot?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, a good while before that, and we received pay quit claim deeds to some of it too. That was outside of this.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>96</questionnumber>

  <question>But you never received any pay, - any way, - for quit claim deeds on any such property in any other county than in Jackson county?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not a bit. Not any Nary a dollar.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>101</questionnumber>
  <question>Doctor when did you discover that your family had any rights in real property here in Independence, or in Jackson County?</question>
  <answer>I expect it has been thirty years. Thee has been lots of lawyers tried to get me to let them take hold of it, and work it for me, but I had enough to eat and so I did not bother about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>102</questionnumber>
  <question>Then Doctor it is a fact that when the opportunity presented itself for the plaintiffs, the re-organized church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, to work it for you, you did not object to their doing so? Is that not the fact Doctor?</question>
  <answer>Well it was before anything of this ever came up that they were after me for it. When this first came up there was nothing in the church about it at all. The church had nothing to do with it at first.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>103</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>I mean that it came in the first place by lawyers in Kansas City. They were after me to let them do something with our property here, and I did not want to do anything, and would not have done anything about it if they had not urged it on me in the first place, - and it took a good deal of urging to get me to do anything too. There was nothing about the church at all when I got hold of it first, - not a bit of the church in it at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>104</questionnumber>
  <question>Though it is a fact, is it not Doctor that you were glad of the opportunity of getting some body to work it out for you?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not cross-examination, and calling for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>Well I don't care much about that either way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>105</questionnumber>
  <question>But it was a part of the consideration that caused you to sign the quit claim deed was it?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is irrelevant and immaterial and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>How is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>106</questionnumber>
  <question>It was never-the-less a part of the consideration that caused you to sign the quit claim deed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was a part of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you Doctor, - did you or your wife ever see any deed to you and her, or anybody to that property, - the property in question?</question>

    </pagenumber>on the ground that it is immaterial and not cross-examination.
  </answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question for the reason and</mono>
  <answer>Certainly I am. Who should be but me?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>109</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any deed amongst her affects for any property here in Jackson County?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is immaterial and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Not that I know anything about.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. P.P. Kelley, "Let me make another objection, there is no claim or pretense on the part of the plaintiffs on this case, that either Dr. Johnson or Marie Louise Johnson, he wife, ever received a deed for the property in controversy in this case from anybody exception Mrs. Oliver Cowdery, but that the title that is claimed by the plaintiffs is through inheritance only".</mono>
  <answer>I did not heat that, for I am very hard of hearing, and it is very awkward for me to be so I assure you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>110</questionnumber>
  <question>I did not ask you a question doctor, I was simply formulating an objection that was all. Now I want to ask you Doctor a question, and it is to the effect if there is any agreement, between you and E.L. Kelley, or was at the time this deed was given by which he agreed to settle the interests of yourself and wife in any property in Jackson County?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not a bit in the world. I could tell you something, well I have answered what you asked me, and if you ask me more I will answer that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>111</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, answer only want I ask you. That is right. Now Doctor I will ask you if it is not a fact that Mrs. Oliver Cowdery from the time you first knew her, up to the time of her death, when reference was made to it at all, claimed that this particular piece of property was church property, what, if any thing did she say in reference to that?</question>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, "I object to that because it is hearsay testimony, and further because it is immaterial and irrelevant"</mono>
  <answer>What is the question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>112</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you doctor if it was not a fact that at all times before her death when Mrs. Oliver Cowdery would refer to this particular piece of property, whether or not she would refer to it as church property. What did she say in reference to that? No I will waive that question Mr. reporter, and ask the doctor this question. What if anything, Mrs. Cowdery said to you at the time of the execution of this deed by yourself and Marie Louise Cowdery her daughter, and your wife, I should say Marie Louise Johnson, as to the nature of the property here in Independence about its being church property or the latter?</question>
  <answer>I never heard her say anything about it, nor never heard it mentioned as church property or anything of the kind. The fact is that there was very little went betwixt us about these things for many years, but after these men began to come there to see me you know, a long time ago, and said that Oliver Cowdery owned a great seal of property in Jackson County, and some in Caldwell, and some in Ray county up there, and this man that told us this wanted to take the matter up you know and see what was in it, but I just laughed at him, for I was no thief you know, so I just paid no attention to it you know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>113</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then do you mean Doctor that by the consideration between you and E.L. Kelley at the time of the execution of the deed, was simply that E.L. Kelley would force a settlement as to this particular piece of property? That is what you mean by the consideration you referred to is it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that is all. there was nothing outside of that at all sir. Not a thing only that</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>114</questionnumber>
  <question>Now on your cross-examination doctor you said it was about two years ago that R.L. Kelley was down at your place?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I think it was about that long ago, but I don't say it was that time postively. I think it was about that time, but I may be mistaken about it. It is all guess work with me as to the length of time ago it was that he was done there, for I declare I cannot recollect when it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>115</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now I will ask you if it was the time when you executed the deed that he was done there?</question>
  <answer>When he was there?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>116</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>117</questionnumber>
  <question>So the date on the deed will show the date that he was there, - that is the time he was there at your place?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, the very time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>118</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he ever there at any other time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never saw him there but the one time, and that was the time. I never saw him but the one time until I saw him here to-day, and the other time I saw him before to-day was the day that he was done there at our place in Mc Donald County.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>119</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever meet Mr Hall down there at your place?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. If that is Mr Hall over there I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>120</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is the gentlemen I referred to?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I saw him down there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>121</questionnumber>
  <question>How much did he offer you for this particular piece of property?</question>
  <answer>He did not offer me anything. He did not make any offer at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>122</questionnumber>
  <question>What did he say he was willing to give you for a dee?</question>
  <answer>I don't think he said he was willing to give anything, or made any offer for it at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>123</questionnumber>
  <question>What was he there for?</question>
  <answer>Well if you just come down to it I couldn't tell you exactly. I didn't know what it meant and I did not either, and I don't know yet what he was there for.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>124</questionnumber>
  <question>Did Mr Hal have any conversation with your wife and your mother-in-law?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think he did a little.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>125</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it? Was it about this particular piece of property?</question>
  <answer>I could not tell you for I don't know. Now there did not appear to be any thing secret about it at all, for I just kept on doing what I had to do? I was out a good deal of the time when he was there, and he would talk to them when I was out, and of course what he said to them is something I don't know anything about, but then there was nothing secret about what passed there. I think that Mr Hall stayed there with us all night. Didn't you?</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Hall, - "Yes, I was there". By Mr P.P. Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>126</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he, - that is did Mr. Hall, make any claim to the property at that time?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't think he did. I think, well as nearly as I can come at it to tell the plain truth, I can't understand it and I think he was there about that piece of ground and wanted it or something, but I don't understand your churches well enough to know the difference between them and so I can'y say just what he was doing. I remember that I told my wife that and she said she did not understand it either exactly. I don't know what he wanted, for he never made any offer for the property.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>127</questionnumber>
  <question>Did Hall claim when he was there, that he was the head of the Latter Day Saints church?</question>
  <answer>I don't think he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>128</questionnumber>
  <question>On your cross-examination Doctor you said, that a good many years ago you found out about your interest in this property</question>
  <answer>Oh yes, - that was a good many years ago.</answer>

  </question>
  <answer>No sir not that long ago.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>130</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how long ago was it?</question>
  <answer>Well I guess it was five or six years ago.</answer>
  <mono>Re-cross examination by Mr. Southern,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>131</questionnumber>
  <question>I have another question to ask for an explanation merely. Now Doctor when in your testimony you have spoken of this particular piece of property, what property do you refer to?</question>
  <answer>I refer to the temple lot.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>132</questionnumber>
  <question>You mean the temple lot?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I mean the temple lot, what is called the "temple lot" here in Independence. Now that is what I mean by I want you to understand that I don't know anything about it on earth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>133</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you mean by the temple lot, the two acres or thereabouts which you quit-claimed, or do you mean the seventy odd acres of which it is a part?</question>
  <answer>I mean the two acres.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>134</questionnumber>
  <question>When you speak of the temple lot you refer to the two acres?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

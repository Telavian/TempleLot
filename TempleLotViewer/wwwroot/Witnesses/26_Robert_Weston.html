  <question>Where do you reside now Mr. Weston?</question>
  <answer>Here in Independence, Missouri.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>6</questionnumber>
  <question>How long have you resided here in Independence, Missouri?</question>
  <answer>I am not certain, but I think my father moved here when I was about eleven or twelve years of age. I am not certain about the time for I was a boy and didn't notice particularly the time that we came here, but I think I was a boy of about twelve years or age when we first came here, and that would make it sixty three years since we came here, - and that is the length of time that I have lived here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>7</questionnumber>
  <question>You have lived here sixty-three years then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>8</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did you live from 1830 to 1854?</question>
  <answer>I lived here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>9</questionnumber>
  <question>In the town of Independence do you mean?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>10</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember when the "Latter Day Saints" first came to Independence?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I remember about that time. I remember of their coming here, but I don't know that I knew the exact day that they first landed here. I do not know that they all came at one time, - I rather think they came off and on from time to time. I remember their coming, but I can't say that I remember the time of their coming.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>11</questionnumber>
  <question>But the fact that they did come and go away again, you remember?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but I don't remember the years exactly. I remember they came here and went away.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>12</questionnumber>
  <question>You remember their coming here, and their going away again?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>13</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you are acquainted with the location of what is known as and what has been spoken of as the Temple property?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir pretty well. I may say I am pretty well acquainted with it and where it is, - and where it is, - and that is to say I know it by passing and repassing it and looking at it, for I had no other interest in it than that, but I have seen it a thousand times I guess.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>14</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know where the present church edifice is located, - the stone church that has been recently built down there, is the one I refer to?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>15</questionnumber>
  <question>Now with reference to that church, where did this Temple property lie?</question>
  <answer>Well we always considered, - we always though it was couth of the road there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>16</questionnumber>
  <question>On the south side of the road there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, right across the road from where the church is there now, - that is on the south side of the Westport road there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>17</questionnumber>
  <question>That road is the street that runs in a south-westerly direction out here, it is not?</question>
  <answer>Well I think it runs pretty near west.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>18</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it runs in a westerly direction?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>19</questionnumber>
  <question>This road that you speak of the "Westport Road" runs out here in a westerly direction past the Temple property?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That was what we called it in the early days, - the "Westport road" and in fact it is called that yet by some of the old-timers, - The road that was called the "Lexington road" led up to it I believe.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>20</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did the Lexington street terminate?</question>
  <answer>At the boundary of the city.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>21</questionnumber>
  <question>At that time you mean?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>22</questionnumber>
  <question>Where was the boundary of the city at that time?</question>
  <answer>Well at that time it was a good deal further east than it is now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>23</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Then if I understand you correctly the street or road to the

      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0008-Pages_503-616-ORIGINAL/79.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 579</a>
    </pagenumber>city, going east, was known as the "Lexington street, after you passed the boundries of the city is was known as the "Westport road"?
  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>24</questionnumber>
  <question>That is how it was designated?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is what we always called it. That is the way it was known here at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>25</questionnumber>
  <question>Now please discribe it s best you can, the present location of what you understand to be the "temple property"? Describe the location of what you under stand to be what property?</question>
  <answer>Well that is something that is rather hard to do. What I understand now as being the "Temple Lot" is that piece of vacant ground across from the present Latter Day Stone church building down there, but at that time I am talking about that whole piece of ground south of the Westport there was called the Temple property. I did not know it was laid off in any particular lot to build the temple on, but I had a general idea that all that ground down south of Westport road there was Temple ground, not that any particular part of it was laid off to build the Temple on but that the whole of it was Temple ground.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>26</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now when you say all that property south of the road, you do not mean just what you say, but you mean to confine it to some particular piece of property there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. It was down there some where about where Pacific street runs there by Wagoner's Mill. It was down in the direction, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>27</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know any thing about a street called "Temple Street"?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>28</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know any thing about that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>29</questionnumber>
  <question>How long has it been since you have seen this property?</question>
  <answer>Not long ago, - I saw it last Sunday.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>30</questionnumber>
  <question>How is that?</question>
  <answer>I went by it last Sunday and saw it. That was the last time I believe I saw it, but I have seen it more than a thousand times I suppose altogether.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>Now where did you say it laid with reference to the stone church down there?</question>
  <answer>Well it lies south of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>32</questionnumber>
  <question>The Temple property, as you understand it, lies south of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>
  <question>And across what, from the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>And across what road did you say?</question>
  <answer>This Westport road or Lexington Avenue.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>35</questionnumber>
  <question>That road then runs between the church and the property known as the Temple Lot?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>36</questionnumber>
  <question>That is where it lies?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I am not certain too, but what the highest point on it is very near there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>37</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it enclosed now?</question>
  <answer>It is now. The ground is enclosed now but it had not been enclosed for a long time during the war, and after the war for a great many years it was not enclosed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>38</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any buildings on it at the present time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir they have a little meeting house there, - just a small little plain meeting house.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>39</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know what denomination has the little meeting house there?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not particularly, - they are called Mormons but what branch of the Mormons I do not know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>40</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know any of the parties that are identified with it?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't know that I am acquainted with them, - not one of them I do not think I use to know Hedricks that got killed out here, - the man that talked so much about it, and he lived out here on the Lexington road.</answer>

  <questionnumber>41</questionnumber>
  <question>That is east of Independence?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>42</questionnumber>
  <question>You said you were here at that time the Mormons, or the Latter Day Saints lived here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>43</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you remember any of the circumstances attending the leaving of the Mormons from this section of the country?</question>
  <answer>The leaving of the Mormons?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>44</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>Well yes sir, some of them I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>45</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then if you remember. I wish you would tell some of the circumstances surrounding them at the time they left?</question>
  <answer>Well just when they left I don't know so much about it for a while before they left for I had been sick a good while then, and was just coming out of a spell of sickness, and was just able to be up and about. I know that the people of the town here gathered up their guns and pistols and weapons of this kind, and went out of the city, for the news had some that the Mormons were gathering our west of the city here to take the town. There was a great seal of excitement about it, and after a while they said the Mormons had concluded not to fight, and they were going away, and after that they went away. I don't remember the time. I don't remember the exact time of that but while there was a lot of excitement and trouble about it at that time there was no killing or blood shed or any thing of that kind. I remember that I went out a piece for I was getting so I could walk, and so I went out a piece west of town to see what could be seen for they said the Mormons were coming out from Westport, and from up above the Blue to take the town, but I could not see anything, and I think there was nothing to the report.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>46</questionnumber>
  <question>You said "they", now whom did you mean by "they"?</question>
  <answer>The citizens of Independence.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>47</questionnumber>
  <question>The citizens of Independence who were not Mormons?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>48</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember anything about the destruction of property that belonged to the Mormons or the people that were called Mormons by the citizens?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Well all I know about that is that it was done and they said it was them did it. I know that property was destroyed, for there was a house right up above where my father lived that was torn down. I mean it was burned up one night, and it was said that it was the anti Mormon element, or the citizens that did it. That belonged to my uncle.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>49</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you know any thing about the destruction of the printing press?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>50</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what do you know about that?</question>
  <answer>I know a good deal about it for I saw them go in there. I saw them go in and knock the door in and take these little things, the type, and throw them out on the street, and they were there in the street for years.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>51</questionnumber>
  <question>What time of the day was that?</question>
  <answer>I do not know for certain. But I think it was in the afternoon.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>52</questionnumber>
  <question>That was in the afternoon you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>53</questionnumber>
  <question>How many people were engaged in that enterprise?</question>
  <answer>I can't say how many there was in the work, but the street was full of people. It was pretty full there was lots of people there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>54</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you now recall the name of any man that was engaged in that work?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>55</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was it?</question>
  <answer>Well John King was the man who knocked the door in.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Traber, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>56</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you see these things yourself?</question>
  <answer>
    Yes sir. I saw him knock the door in. There was a man named Franklin there too, and the

      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0008-Pages_503-616-ORIGINAL/81.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 581</a>
    </pagenumber>way I know Franklin was there was because there was an old fellow there by the name of Warner, and old Franklin struck him and knocked him in the street. I saw that and that is how I know these two men were there. I did not know the men at the time, but they said it was him, at any rate I saw this man knock Warner down and afterwards I was told it was Franklin.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>57</questionnumber>
  <question>Where were you when you saw this?</question>
  <answer>I was only a boy, but I was there on top of a shed and in a good place to see about all that was going on. I was there on the shed taking it all in, and I saw them fighting there. The way it was they were fighting there, and this old man Franklin took a hand into it and knocked this man Warner down, and I heard Franklin say afterwards that he thought it was time to stop it. That was Bill Franklin's father who did that.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Traber,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>58</questionnumber>
  <question>What did they knock the door in with?</question>
  <answer>Well I forget just what it was, but I think it was some stuff that they had hauled up there to make boards of. I think it was some of that stuff that they had hauled up for that purpose, for you know in the early days in this country they use to make a good many boards out of stuff that would be cur for that purpose out of timber, and he took up one of these pieces, and went up the stairway and knocked the door in with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>59</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it you said he took up the stairs and knocked the door in with?</question>
  <answer>It was one of these pieces of woof that they made boards out of, or did make boards out of in those days, for of course there is no boards made in that way now, at least not in this part of the country. I don't know now what it was called. I can't remember, but I used to know what they called these things, but I forget what they did call it. What was the name of the pieces of wood they used to make board out of?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>60</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it was a chunk of wood, a stick?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir a piece of timber.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>61</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what other property was destroyed at that time that you know anything about personally?</question>
  <answer>Well there was lots of property destroyed that they destroyed. I am satisfied the mob did it but I did not see it personally. I am satisfied of that although I did not see it, and I do not know exactly what it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>62</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you know Mr. Weston about any stores being broken into?</question>
  <answer>Well I know Algernon Gilbert had a store up there, but I don't think it was destroyed, at that time I don't think it was destroyed any way. I don't know, but I don't think it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>63</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember seeing any goods in the street?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I did not. They may have been there, but I did not see them if they were, at any rate I have not any recollection of it now. Gilbert was a very nice fellow and I don't think anybody troubled him at all, but it might possibly have been done, and I not know it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>64</questionnumber>
  <question>It might have been done, and you not know it you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. It might have been done and I not know it. This man Gilbert was a nice smooth fellow, and I do not think anybody troubled him but still they might have done so, and I not know it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>65</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember seeing Edward Partridge at any time?</question>
  <answer>I do not remember the name.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>66</questionnumber>
  <question>Well Mr. Partridge?</question>
  <answer>I remember a Bishop Partridge they all called him.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>67</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what do you know about him?</question>
  <answer>I remember seeing some fellows have the old man out one day and putting tar and feathers.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>68</questionnumber>
  <question>Where was that,-was that here in Independence that you saw that being done?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir,-right up here in the Court house lot they did that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>69</questionnumber>
  <question>He was tarred and feathered?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. 70 How many were tarred and feathered besides him at that time?</answer>
  <answer>There was another man,-I think a fellow by the name of Allen is all I can recollect.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>71</questionnumber>
  <question>How many of the good citizens had any thing to do with it?</question>
  <answer>Well if any of the good citizens had any thing to do with it I don't recollect seeing them there. I don't think that any good citizen had any thing to do with it, or with any of these troubles but at that time we had a lot of bad citizens there. I remember the fellow that was putting the tar on him was named Jonathan Shepherd, and he was a rough customer,-not a good citizen by any means. I don't think that any first class citizens were engaged in it at that time,- at least I would not consider then so. This man Johnathan Shepherd was a good for nothing, no account fellow, who never did any thing,- never did any good for himself or any body else, and there was another old fellow there named Bill Connor that was of no earthly account nohow,-he was living down here a the time, and he was a regular wild old fellow, and was never happy unless he was in trouble or getting other people in it. (Handwritten in right side margin: He took a very active part in this tar and feather business and then he wanted to cowhide Bishop Partridge and they stopped him and would not let him do it.)</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>72</questionnumber>
  <question>How many people were about at the time?</question>
  <answer>Well there was a lot of them there. I don't know how many, but there was good many there. I was a boy at the time and was running around kind of wild like looking for any thing that might turn up, but I remember that at the time I thought what they were doing was not right and I felt right sorry for the old man.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>73</questionnumber>
  <question>You remember that you were?</question>
  <answer>Well yes sir I was there but I was on a roof,- I was one of the audience.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>74</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am talking about the "audience"?</question>
  <answer>Well I was there but did not have any thing to do with it, and I did not think it was right either. I remember right well that I was there, but if there was any other man there good, bad or indifferent, toher that these I have named, for the life of me I could not tell you who they were.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>75</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am talking about the lookers on?</question>
  <answer>Well I was one of the lookers on, and there was plenty of people there, but I can't say who they were. I was a boy and I wanted to see the sights and I saw them on that occasion too. The incident made a very vivid impression on my mind, or I remember seeing the old fellow going our of town west, and he had his hot on to keep the sun out of his eyes. He helt it up to keep the sun out of his eyes but he could not put it on account of the tar. I remember that I felt right sorry for the old fellow and felt that it was a great outrage.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>76</questionnumber>
  <question>How long prior to that occurrence had these disturbances been going on?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know but I suppose it must have been a year that they were talking and fussing around about before that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how long subsequent to that transaction was it before the Mormons left the city?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say as to that either, but I think that was about the time they went away.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>78</questionnumber>
  <question>About that time they went away?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, about that time.</answer>

  <questionnumber>79</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were any of them permitted to stay after that time?</question>
  <answer>What is that question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>80</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if any of them were permitted to remain after that time?</question>
  <answer>I do not know that any of them were.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>81</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know that any of them were permitted to remain after that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and I do not think they did remain, though I do not know about that, but I do not think they did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>82</questionnumber>
  <question>How long was it subsequent to the tarring and feathering of Bishop Partridge, that this sentiment against the Mormons obtained?</question>
  <answer>How long afterwards?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>83</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>84</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it a long or short period of time that this feeling or sentiment against the Mormons, as they were termed prevailed here?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say how long it was, but it was a good long while, - a good many years any way. I couldn't say exactly how long it was but I know for a good many years there was a bitter feeling here against them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>85</questionnumber>
  <question>It prevailed for several years then.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>86</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you from that time down until in very recent years, that the same sentiment has prevailed generally amongst the people?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know. As far as my knowledge extends I must say that I do not know. I think though as a people they were not very well thought of in this section of country an din the minds of some people there was doubtless a very bitter feeling against the, - It was about like it is now, - for there is a great many people living here yet who don't think much of Mormons any way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>87</questionnumber>
  <question>Why of course?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, here is people living here now that have not much use for Mormons and don't think very much of them now, but of course it is nothing like what it was at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>88</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is what I thought?</question>
  <answer>Well in that respect it was about the same then as it is now, and there was several years I don't know how many, but a good many years, that they did not feel that they were safe here, and so they did not come around unless they did it secretly. I know a brother-in-law of mine who was a blacksmith shop and a man by the name of Cornack came from out in the country here eight or nine miles and ordered him off.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>89</questionnumber>
  <question>When was that?</question>
  <answer>I do not know the year.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>90</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it afterwards?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>91</questionnumber>
  <question>Several years afterwards?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I don't know how many years afterwards.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>92</questionnumber>
  <question>A year or two afterwards was it not?</question>
  <answer>Two or three years after afterwards or something like that. He was suspected of being a Mormon and so he was ordered off. I mention that simply to show what feeling prevailed at the time in the country regarding the Mormons, and none of them were permitted to stay if it were known or suspected they were Mormons.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>93</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then I understand you to say that the sentiment about the time of the tarring and feathering of Bishop Partridge here, in opposition to what you have called the Mormons, has continued down to the present time, and the opinion of the people, -</question>
  <answer>
    Well now I want to say that I don't think the sentiment of the people generally at that time was in the favor of doing that thing. It was a thing that was done by some rough characters in the community, and I don't think it represented the sentiment of the people generally at all at that time. I do not believe the people of Independence

    </pagenumber>the best people of Independence approved of what was done, but then they did not rise and try to prevent it when it was done. They let these rough characters work their will on them I don't believe the best people of the country wanted to do that sort of thing, but as far as driving them off is concerned. I expect there was a great many good men wanted them to go away, but as far as doing them personal damage either to their business houses or persons is concerned, I do not believe they would have done it, or did do any thing of the kind. Now that is the best people, but there is question that on the other hand the unruly turbulent element that was amongst the people here in the early days, and down until after the war, did do then a great deal of damage, and made it unsafe for them to stay here. I know I would have felt that way if I had been in their place. It was a case of where the mob got the upper hand, that is the way I look at it.

  <question>Well now what efforts were made by the citizens to prevent it?</question>
  <answer>To prevent what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>95</questionnumber>
  <question>To prevent these outrages from being perpetrated on the Mormons?</question>
  <answer>Well I was out in the country just about where this man Warneke lives now, and there was a little shanty there, and a lot of fellows came along there, and one of them jumped upon top of that, and went to tear it down, and they were stopped and not permitted to do so. They would not let them do it, and that was the nearest I ever saw them come to doing damage and not do it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>96</questionnumber>
  <question>When was that?</question>
  <answer>That was in the neighborhood of the time they went off from here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>97</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now I thought you said in the first place there was a good deal of property destroyed here?</question>
  <answer>Well I saw so still, but I did not see it all done. I know they did not teat that little old shanty down then, but they may have done so afterwards.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>98</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the reason they did not tear it down?</question>
  <answer>Warneke hollered to them to let it alone, and they did let it alone. The way I come to see so much as I did was because I did not have much to do and I was knocking around seeing what I could see, that was the reason I came to see as much as I did.</answer>

  <questionnumber>140</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, did they call it a lot then?</question>
  <answer>I think they called it the Temple lot, but I always understood that the whole tract of land from away down there towards Chrismans or that factory there or up to the Westport road, and away down there, was called the Temple lot of ground. I remember at one time we went down there to view it, or to view some of it at one time. Mr. Max well and Woodson got old John Parker and me and Richard Pigall to do it.</answer>

  <question>Then what you refer to was called the Temple lot, or Temple property, - or rather Mormon property was it not?</question>
  <answer>We always called it the Temple lot.</answer>

  <question>Do you know that it went by that name generally?</question>
  <answer>That is what I always called it, - I cannot say what other people called it I understood that all that piece of ground was called the Temple lot or property.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>145</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now are you sure that the whole of that property was ever called that, or was known by that appelation so to speak?</question>
  <answer>I know what I always considered was the Temple property. I can speak for myself only, and don't know what other people considered was the temple property. I know in my own mind I always thought so, but I don't know what other people thought.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>146</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you spoke of a large body of land south of the Westport road?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>147</questionnumber>
  <question>What was that?</question>
  <answer>Well that was all embraced in this same temple lot. It was all embraced in this same piece of ground that the Mormons had at one time when they were here. It was all Temple ground according to my under standing of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>148</questionnumber>

  <question>You have seen Mormons on it have you not?</question>
  <answer>On this land?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>151</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well I have seen some shanties on it, and they were going to pull them done, but they would not let it be done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>152</questionnumber>
  <question>Who would not let that be done?</question>
  <answer>Some of the crowd that was along would not let the ones that wanted to do that, do it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>153</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know whether the citizens of the town generally ever held picnics out there on that ground, or other gatherings on that ground?</question>
  <answer>I do not know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>154</questionnumber>
  <question>Aside form the Mormons I mean?</question>
  <answer>If they did I do not know it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>155</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know, you say, anything about that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I am not a picnic man myself and if that was done I don't know anything about it. I did not notice that if it was done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>156</questionnumber>
  <question>You were a boy at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and at that time picnics had not come in yet.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>157</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know of any general gatherings out there of any kind or discription about that time?</question>
  <answer>Well they hung a fellow for murder there once, and that was the most general gathering I ever saw there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>158</questionnumber>
  <question>Where was that?</question>
  <answer>I can't say just the exact spot it was, but it was there pretty close to the Temple lot. It seems to me that it was not very far from the street running down there from pleasant Place. I think it was near that street there some where, but I said I could not point out the exact place but it was right there near the temple lot some place. It was a little west of that I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>159</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it on the temple ground?</question>
  <answer>I am not certain that it was but it was thereabouts.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>160</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how far was that from the Westport road?</question>
  <answer>Where this fellow was hung do you mean?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>161</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well it was about two-hundred yards I suppose from the road to the place where they hung the man. I know they were there preaching and praying with him all day nearly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>162</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that before the war?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was before the war.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>163</questionnumber>
  <question>How long before the war was it?</question>
  <answer>Well it was some where about '38 I think. It was long about that time that that man was hung there. It might have been a little before that time. I was working for myself at that time, and I knew the man that was killed for which this fellow was hung. I knew the man that was killed very well, and it was a fellow named Hawkins, - the fellow that built the Hawkins mill, and the man that killed him was the fellow they hung out there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>164</questionnumber>
  <question>And you say this occurance of the execution of this man out there was about 1838?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think about that time, but it may have been later than that, - I might have been not far from '40 I think. I am not at all sure of the date, but it was some where along there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>165</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember whether at any time, any of that ground out there that you speak of as being temple ground, was ever in cultivation?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know. If you call putting it in meadow cultivation I don't know about that. I think some of it was in meadow at one time, but I would not call that cultivation hardly. Woodson Took in some of it, and built a stone fence around it, and I think it was a meadow it was used for.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>166</questionnumber>
  <question>At what time was that?</question>
  <answer>
    Well it was about 1845 or some time along there. I remember at the time old John Parker was living

  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>167</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever remember seeing a fence running along the south side of the Westport road, enclosing this lot in controversy?</question>
  <answer>I do not recollect anything about that until of recent years. I know they have a fence there now, but I don't recollect of a fence being there until this fence was put there, still there may have been, — If there was I do not recollect it though.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>168</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you not recollect that at one time there was what was known as a worn fence all along the Westport road, embracing the whole distance of that lot on the south side of the road?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember that but there might have been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>169</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see that land there in corn and pumpkins?</question>
  <answer>Well I may have seen it, but if I did I have forgotten it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>170</questionnumber>
  <question>I refer to a time along prior to the war?</question>
  <answer>It might have been there all the time before that, but if it was I say I don't recollect it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>171</questionnumber>
  <question>This is with reference as to whether it was bare ground or not?</question>
  <answer>Well it is nice, pretty ground, —the finest piece of ground in the country I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>172</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, I agree with you, Now you do not as I understand you state postively here, that all that piece of ground was timbered ground.</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>173</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not as I understand you you, I say, state postively here, that all that ground was timbered ground, —that is had timber on it?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not say what it was, but my impression is that it was timbered land. I know though that that was the the general nature of the ground, —it had timber on it at one time but how much of it was timbered when they got it I do not know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>174</questionnumber>
  <question>In '31 and '32 and '33, there was timber had been on the ground where what is called the Temple lot is now fenced, —there was timber then on that ground?</question>
  <answer>There was, —there had been or was at that time, but I do not know about that either postively, for about that time I think they had cut it off or were cutting it off.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>175</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did they cut the fuel then, what sort of fuel was used in this town at that time?</question>
  <answer>Every body used wood for fuel in this country at that time, and the people in town got there fuel off this ground and the country round here, —for the country all round here at that time was timbered, and a person could go out almost any where and out what wood he wanted.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>176</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you call to mind, or can you call to mind any Mormons who were here in 1834 engaged in some suit against citizens of this place for what occured on the street here in the way of outrages against those men?</question>
  <answer>No I do not remember anything about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>177</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say they were not here?</question>
  <answer>No sir, they may have been here I say I don't remember anything about it if they were. I think at one time there came over a lot of them from Clay County, or Liberty, to have some law suits here, but I did not pay much attention to it, but I recollect seeing them here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>178</questionnumber>
  <question>About what date was that about '34 or '35?</question>
  <answer>It was about '34 or '35, —some where along there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>179</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is what I referred to, —Now was there some litigation about those times with reference to the abuse which these men had received?</question>
  <answer>
    They came over here to a have a suit on account of these outrages. They brought suit against the citizens here I think, and they came here to have a trial in the court, and there came some soldiers to protect them, and I recollect seeing them come in but further than that I did not care anything about it

    </pagenumber>and I did not go to see anything about it, for I did not care anything about it, at all.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>180</questionnumber>
  <question>You say there was soldiers came with them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, to protect them as I understood it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>181</questionnumber>
  <question>Were these soldiers militia?</question>
  <answer>No sir, they were United States soldiers. Now that is my impression, - and I am not sure about that either, but that is what I think they were.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>182</questionnumber>
  <question>There was not very many of the soldiers?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>183</questionnumber>
  <question>Now was there any disturbance at that time with reference to the Mormons?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Not at all, - not at that time. None that I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>184</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was in 1834 we will say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, about that time 1834 or '35.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>185</questionnumber>
  <question>Now from that time on up for twenty years, up to 1854, was there ever any disturbances with references to the Mormons that might come in here or not?</question>
  <answer>Not that I ever know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>186</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you call to mind of any of the Mormons coming in here during these years?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't remember of any of them coming in.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>187</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not all to mind anything of the kind?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>188</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you said there were certain outrages perpertrated upon the Mormons here in this city in 1833?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>189</questionnumber>
  <question>And you went on and described at length these outrages as you saw them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, to the best of my ability I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>190</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you know anything about what was the cause of these outrages you spoke of?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>191</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know anything about what was the cause of these outrages or disturbances?</question>
  <answer>Well I know what was said to be the cause of the disturbances, - In buying property they would go to a fellow it is said, - I know of one particular case, - a fellow by the name of Baker he said so, - Baker said you might as well sell, for if you don't sell it you will have to leave the country". Now that is the way it was, and it was these kind of things that brought up the trouble. Now I don't know anything about this of my own knowledge, - it is just hearsay, - what was told me.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the winess and moves court to exclude same from the record for the reason that it is hearsay.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>192</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there, or was there not some current reasons given at the time of the attacks upon the Mormons?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and wholly immaterial, and hearsay, and improper cross-examination.</mono>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>193</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question, - you need not pay any attention to what these gentlemen say, for they are only availing themselves of their legal right to interpose their formal objection?</question>
  <answer>Well state the question again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>194</questionnumber>
  <question>Well the question, I asked you was, was there, or was there, not some common understanding, which accounted for the outrages you speak of as having been committed against the Mormons at this time?</question>
  <answer>Well just what I told you was the first cause, - they said it was reported that the people would have to go and give their property up if they would not sell it. That seemed to be the chief reason for the expression of feeling made by the citizens.</answer>
  <pagenumber>
    <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0008-Pages_503-616-ORIGINAL/93.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 591</a>
  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>195</questionnumber>
  <question>What was that?</question>
  <answer>Well because they said if the people did not sell their property they would have to leave anyhow. I don't know that they said that mind you, for I did not hear any of them so state the fact to be, —that is I did not hear any of the Mormons make that statement or any thing like it, but it was said to be the case that they did talk that way, and that was one of the chief reasons for the feeling that sprang up here against them.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff moves the court to exclude from the record the answer of the witness, for the reason that it is heresay.</mono>
  <answer>I don't believe there was anything in it myself, but that was the common talk about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>196</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr.Weston do you say that the citizens of this town generally and the citizens of this vicinity, generally, were engaged in that tarring and feathering that was done there as has been testified to here?</question>
  <answer>Well there was a good many around here at the time, —that is they were around where it was going on, but whether they were engaged in it or not I do not know. These rough characters that I told you about did the actual work, but these other people were around there and did not interfere with them in their work, and whether they were aiding and abetting them in their work I don't know about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>197</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that a great many citizens were there simply as spectators?</question>
  <answer>I know I was there simply as a spectator and there was a good many other citizens there looking around, but these men seemed to be the active ones in the performance, —I can't say whether the others were there as spectators or not, but I assume that some of them were.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>198</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know of any reason why Mormons would not have been safe here in 1840 or 1850 or 1860, or at any other inter—mediate time?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper cross—examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>199</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know whether or not they would have been safe here at any of those times?</question>
  <answer>What times.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>200</questionnumber>
  <question>In 1840 or 1850 or 1860, or any inter—mediate time?</question>
  <answer>Well I do not know as a general thing whether they would or not. There was some people in the community at that time you speak of that I have no doubt would have done them harm if they could, but I do not believe that the people of the community at those times would have countenanced any outrages on them, —as far back as 1840 I do not think they would.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>201</questionnumber>
  <question>How about as far back as 1860?</question>
  <answer>Well some of them I believe would, —I believe candidly that some of the hot headed ones would have been disposed to annoy them and persecuted them at that time, for the feeling had not subsided at that time. I think so because a fellow by the name of Rockland I think it was. At any rate some one attempted to assassinate Gov. Boggs, and it was said to be a fellow by the name of Rockland He was said to be the fellow that did it, and that got up another enmity against the Mormons.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>202</questionnumber>
  <question>When was that?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember the date.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>203</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about when was it?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember the date but it was some where along about 1841, and Govener Boggs lived here at the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>204</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was there such a disposition in 1855 or 1860?</question>
  <answer>
    Well I don't know about that. I don't think there would have been anything done to the Mormons at that time if they had come here but

    </pagenumber>as I said before there were people here who did not have any love for the Mormons, and are to this day, but I don't think the sense of the community would have tolerated any violence's to them at that time, still it may be that if they had come back there would have been violence offered them. It is just this way that the people generally did not like them, but I don't think they would have hurt them if they had come back at that time.

  <questionnumber>205</questionnumber>
  <question>Have there not been more or less of the people that are called Mormons here since 1865?</question>

I do not pay much attention to these things, but I am under the impression that there has been some of them here since that time. I know that old Dr. McClellen and a good many others have been here for years, but how long they have been here, or when they came I don't know. I think, -</answer>

  <question>Have they been disturbed by rowdyism as a special class of people or have any outrages been perpertrated upon them because of their religious belief, or from any other reason?</question>

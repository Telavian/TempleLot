  <questionnumber>24</questionnumber>
  <question>And you were one of the company you say that went out to open this road across the state of Iora?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I was one of the band of pioneers, there was a company of one hundred able bodied men chosen.

I was married then, but I was young.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>25</questionnumber>

  <answer>We were to go across the state and open road, and throw bridges across all the stream, that needed it across the state, and especially to establish a ferry across the Missouri river into what was called winter quarters eight miles above Omaha, now where Omaha now stands, for there was no Omaha there at that time, it was the Omaha nation then.</answer>

  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>32</questionnumber>
  <question>Well go on and state all the reasons you had for leaving winter quarters?</question>
  <answer>That was one reason why I left winter quarters but perhaps it was not the main reason. I left winter quarters because I was satisfied in my own mind that everything was not as it should be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was your reason, just state your reason for leaving winter quarters at the time you did and not your conclusions as to what you saw, just state what was your reason?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I was satisfied that the twelve or what was there of them, Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball, and Richards and the rest of the twelve that were there, had forsaken the original platform that we stood on, that is the doctrine that is contained in the Bible the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, they forsook the doctrine taught in these books and treated them as not worth the ashes of a rye straw, and did not consider them to be as good as a last years almanac.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the substitute they established for them, if any thing?</question>
  <answer>The substitute was to obey the council of the twelve in all things.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>35</questionnumber>
  <question>Was the council of the twelve considered supreme?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I went there to winter quarters with them but I saw how things were going on, and I got away as soon as I could, for I was to well posted, to follow them any further. I found out then for the first time that what I heard was true and what they were doing, but the same things was talked of for the first time I heard it there in Nauvoo in the spring of 1845.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>36</questionnumber>
  <question>What was that talked of?</question>
  <answer>Of polygamy being practiced secretly amongst some of them, and I never found it out to be a fact until I got to winter quarters in 1846 and 1847, and I found it out then to be a fact. I had heard of it before, but that was the first time I found it out to be a fact beyond doubt.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>37</questionnumber>
  <question>Now did you have any difficulty in getting away from there?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <pagenumber>
    <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0008-Pages_503-616-ORIGINAL/98.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 595</a>
  </pagenumber>
  <answer>Well not particularily. I would if I had undertaken to go away on my own hook, but the scheme I worked got me out of winter quarters without any special difficulty.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>38</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how did you get away from winter quarters?</question>
  <answer>Well I was very intimate with Brigham Young, and he claimed authority over the ferry that we had made there. I mean the ferry that we pioneers had build there the time that we were sent out from Nauvoo to build these roads that I spoke of, and to establish this ferry over the Missouri river. Well when we came to the river and crossed it to winter quarters, Brigham Young then claimed jurisdiction over this ferry, and he would not allow any one to cross the river back on the Iowa side without a permit from him, or without his knowledge. Everybody had to have a permit or his permission to cross the river. He said we could apostatise all we had a mind to, but the property that was once in the church never could apostatise so he would keep that. Well as I said being intimately acquainted with him, and being good friends. I went to him and told him I wanted to go down in Missouri, - or down into Egypt as we called it to St Joseph, for I was a carpenter and wages were good there, and I could make a good living, and I had run out of money and wanted a permit to go over the river on the ferry and go down to St Joseph. I made that request of Brigham Young, and after I was through he ordered Judd Grant his secretary, to make it out for me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>39</questionnumber>
  <question>who was this man?</question>
  <answer>He was Judd Grant, and he was Brigham Young's secretary at that time, and did all his writing for him. I knew both him and Brigham Young right well, and in fact I was well acquainted with all the twelve that were there, and indeed I was in a good many of their counsels and confidences, and that is how I came to get a little more intimate with Brigham Young than the generality of the people did, and had an understanding of what was going on a good deal better than many did that were there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>40</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now was it because of your financial condition, or was it or was it because of the actions of the church that you left winter quarters as you did?</question>
  <answer>Well I was going away any way. I had made up my mind to leave any way. I was going across the river some way or another, for I had made up my mind to leave any away, and run the risk but I staid until after the spring conference.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>41</questionnumber>
  <question>When was that conference held?</question>
  <answer>It was on the 6th of April same time that we have our conferences now at the present time. The spring conferences have always been held at the same time I believe. Well at that conference the main question at issue appeared to be that none of Joseph's family was along. At that time we understood and believed as we do today, that Joseph should be the successor of his father. We understood that would be the case, and Brigham had made of his attempt to get any of them to accompany him a failure. He had offered inducements, - all that could be offered, and they would not go.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>42</questionnumber>
  <question>Who would not go?</question>
  <answer>Joseph's family, - none of them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>43</questionnumber>
  <question>Why?</question>
  <answer>
    Well because they had no confidence in Brigham Young and another thing was that there was nothing to indicate that there was any need of going to California, for they were suppose then to be going to California, and in the spring conference the old elders in the church were finding a good deal of fault, for they all believed universally that through Joseph and his posterity was promised in the Doctrine and Covenants, had the authority to rule in power, and would remain in the church as its head

    </pagenumber>until the coming of Christ as is set forth in the Doctrine and Covenants., - as God had promised unto Abraham, so had he promised unto Josepk, that upon him and the head of his posterity should the power rest to lead the church. "In thee and thy seed shall the kindred be blessed". Well as I stated there was a great many of the minstry of the church who were dissatisfied and gave expression to their dissatisfaction, and in that conference Brigham Young made the statement, and Heber C. Kimball and Dr Richards and the rest of the twelve that were in winter quarters were there, that they did not want any thing more she stated it there and they had talked it over, - for it had got noised abroad there and back in Illinois that the family was there, - and he said that he might just as well draw a knife and cur the boys throat, as to be talking of such a thing, for it was known in Illinois that that promise was made, -
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>44</questionnumber>
  <question>What promise do you mean?</question>
  <answer>The promise to exalt him to the head of the church, - Brigham said we might as well draw a knife and cut the boys throat, - referring to young Joseph Smith, - as to let it get abroad that he was to the be the head of the Church. He said that if that knowledge got abroad in Illinois that the promise was made, and the saints looked to such a thing being fulfilled, that they would put an end to the family.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>45</questionnumber>
  <question>What family?</question>
  <answer>Joseph's family. He said not to talk of such a thing or even think of it, for if the people back there in Illinois thought that the saints expected or looked forward to the fulfillment of the matter they would put an end to the entire family, and so he said to publicly talk of such a thing would belike taking a knife and cutting their throats.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>46</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now are you stating this from what you know personally, - what you heard?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, it is from what I heard personally for it was in the general conference that was held there in the spring in April at Winter quarters. Brigham Yong got up at the Conference and made the statement himself personally that no man could stand in Joseph's place, for he said he had seen him ordained and set apart to fill his fathers place, and that that place belonged to him by right, - and God would take care of him and bring him forward at the right time, - there was no trouble about that at all.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "I have not been objecting to any thing that has been asked the witness, or to any of his answer, although in my opinion many of them are objectionable, for I supposed that it was understood that this was being taken in accordance with the terms of our agreement regarding objects to testimony entered into a short time ago, that all your questions are objected to on the ground that they are irrelevant and incompetent." By Mr. Traber, - "Yes sir, your objections can run to every question that I have asked". By Mr. Southern, - "And in this case this testimony is objected to because it is hearsay". By Mr. Traber, - "Yes sir, and you can object to this or any other question on any ground conceivable, if you choose to do so".</mono>
  <answer>I have state just what I know personally myself, and what I have stated is not hearsay. Hundred of others were at the same time and heard just what I have stated and a great many of them are living to day.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Traber, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>47</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what were you going to say?</question>
  <answer>
    I was going to say that when I got permission to cross the river that just suited me so I

    </pagenumber>struck out for St Joseph, I made up my mind then that I would go to St Joseph, Missouri, and I did go as soon as I could get ready to start, and it did not take me very long to start either for I was anxious to get away from the place.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>48</questionnumber>
  <question>How long did you live there at S Joseph?</question>
  <answer>I lived there from the spring of 1847 until 1853.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>49</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did you go then?</question>
  <answer>In the spring of 1853 about thirty-five or forty of us all moved up in Iowa together.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>50</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say "thirty-five or forty of us", what do you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>I mean that in 1853 I moved back up into Iowa.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>51</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what do you mean by "us"?</question>
  <answer>Old Latter Day Saints that went from Winter Quarters and from places in Iowa down there to St Joseph. They came from western Iowa down there to St Joseph about the same time I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>52</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you maintain or have nay organization in St Joseph?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>53</questionnumber>
  <question>Why not?</question>
  <answer>Well there was several reasons why we did not do it. We were a little afraid to do that for there was a good many bitter enemies of the Latter Day Saints there at the start. We Held our meetings regularly after we had been there a while, and in time showed the people that we were honorable and were not afraid to work for our living, and in that way gained many friend there. We began by holding our meetings at private houses at first, - For example we would have a meeting say at my house, and then at an other mans house, and so on. Brother Hall, now a Bishops agent in Council Bluffs was one with me. He is alive, but the most of them are now dead. We held our meetings every Sunday almost, - first at one house and then at another, - kind of secret meetings amongst ourselves they were.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>54</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you had no public place of worship at that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>55</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>57</questionnumber>
  <question>Did the whole thirty five of you got in a body?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for St Joseph we went in a body, and the most of us went in a body from Council Bluffs and settled in what is now Montana County.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>58</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you have a public place of worship at any of these points?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>60</questionnumber>
  <question>What did you know, if any thing, at that time, about the Mormons intending to occupy lands here in Jackson County or here at Independence?</question>
  <answer>
    Well there was a good many in St Joseph, - some pretty influential men too, who had lived there in this vicinity. There was Middleton and Riley, wealthy merchants who bought most all their goods in St Louis, and they came through here often going backwards and forwards, when they went through by land, and they got intimately acquainted with us, for they were very fine men, but did not belong to the church, - they did not belong to any church, - and they thought a good deal of the Later day Saints there in

  <answer>Well they knew a great deal about it, - by hearsay of course.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>62</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was it?</question>
  <answer>This man Middleton I have spoken of who traveled through this country on his way to St Louis and returning, - and who talked a great deal with the people here I suppose, I asked him what he thought about the people here I suppose, I asked him what he thought about the people down here, and he thought it would not be safe for a Latter Day Saints to come down here, and let the fact be known that he was a Latter Day Saint.</answer>

That revelation was in our books, and we believed it would eventually be a center place of gathering.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>70</questionnumber>

  <question>What do they expect from holding that position?</question>

  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now if that was true, why is it that the gathering of the people at this place has been postponed to such a late date?</question>
  <answer>Well it was on account of their neighbors getting uneasy, -getting jealous, seeing so many of the Latter Day Saints coming in here at Independence, and as most of the latter Day Saints that came here were eastern men and women, and they were well educated people and their neighbors got jealous of them, for they were prospering wherever they were, -</answer>

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>It was?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>92</questionnumber>
  <question>And it was not safe for them to be here at that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not think so. I know I came very near trading my farm for a place here in 1866, and the man had to leave here to save his life, and I was afraid to trade with him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>93</questionnumber>
  <question>You were afraid?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I was afraid to trade with him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>94</questionnumber>

  <question>What did he leave here for?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know but I suppose it was because everything was cut up here in the war of the rebellion and he had to leave because he got into trouble with some of the factions here, for I understand they were a rough set around here at that time, or just after it. He was not a Latter Day Saint at all, and that had nothing to do with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>99</questionnumber>
  <question>Then, why do you mention this occurence as an evidence of hospitality against the Latter Day Saints?</question>

  <question>Then you do not want to create the impression that he left here in 1868 because he was a Latter Day Saint, - that this man was forced to leave this country because of that fact?</question>
  <answer>Oh no, no, for he was not a Latter Day Saint at all. I would have traded with him pretty quick, but I was afraid to come here, and I aint much of a coward wither I don't think.</answer>

  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>What I understood by endowments, - what it should be, - would be the teachings and instructions from the ceremonies, - I mean the instructions delivered from God through the sermon of his prophets and apostles. That would be an endowment in the manner in which wisdom would be given to the Saints through the ministry of the church that were going to be sent out to the nations of the earth to preach the gospel unto all who would hear. It would be the special gift of the Holy Ghost and the Spirit to such to enable them to administer the Gospel in power. It was instructions given to the ministry of the church more particularly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>241</questionnumber>
  <question>Of what did those endowments consist?</question>
  <answer>They consisted of the Spirit of God being given to the prophet and to the officers of the church and ministry, and instructions to send them out to preach in the fields and labor in the interests of the church wherever they would be called to labor, and to the end that sucess would crown their efforts. They were to be sent to the different nations of the earth by a special revelation.</answer>

Behold the place which is now called Independence, is the center place and the spot for the temple is lying westward upon a lot which is not far from the Court House, wherefore it is wisdom that the land should be purchased by the Saints; and also every tract lying westward, even unto the line running directly between Jew and Gentile. And also every tract bordering by the prairies, inasmuch as my disciples are enabled to buy lands. Behold this is wisdom that they may obtain it for an everlasting inheritance". By Mr. Traber, "For the purpose of offering in evidence certain portions of a book which I now hold in my hand, we would like to have it marked as an exhibit, the title page of which is as follows, "The spiritual wife system proven false, and the true order of church discipline illustrated by Granville Hedrick, Bloomington, Illinois. W.E. Foote's power press printing house, 1856. The book above referred to, is marked "Exhibit W.J.M. Orr". By Mr. Southern, "To these exhibits, or to the last three exhibits offered in evidence the defendants offer their objection on the ground of irrelevancy, and because the books which they have been taken have not been identified as the law requires, and because none of the extracts offered in testimony or in evidence have been placed in the hands of the defendant or his counsel so they may examine them with reference to this case". By Mr. Traber, "The plaintiff now offers the defendants or any of them or their counsel or attorney the privilege of examining any books offered in evidence by the plaintiff, and any and all parts of the books so offered".

Counsel for the plaintiff Mr. E.L. Kelley hereupon hands counsel for the defendants the book marked Exhibit "W". By Mr. Southern Defendant further objects to the use in this cause of Exhibit "W" entitled "The Spiritual Wife system proven false, and the true order of church discipline illustrated by Granville Hedrick", published in 1856 on the ground that it does not pertain to the organization of either the plaintiff or defendant in this case, and is representative only of the pinion of its author".

By Mr. Traber, "Yes sir, we can state for what purpose, we offer exhibit "W" in evidence for the purpose of showing what was recognized as the true name of the church by the author Granville Hedrick, and also for the purpose of showing what book of Doctrine and Covenants were then recognized, at the date of the publication of this work in 1856". By Mr. Southern, "To which offer the defendants object, because it has not been shown that Granville Hedrick was qualified to speak on the matters for which this book is offered in evidence". By Mr. E.L. Kelley, We have not got through with this offer yet colonel". 611 By Mr. Southern,-"Well I thought you were through, but if you are not I will wait until you get through". By Mr. Traber,-"And also for the purpose of showing the doctrinal views of the author at that date. The complete preface is offered, pages 3, 4, and 5." By Mr. Southern,-"Defendant objects to the testimony offered because it is not of importance in this case that Granville Hedrick taught or believed in 1856; and because it has not been shown by any testimony in this case that Granville Hedrick was qualified to speak as an expert or other wise, as to the matters contained in the extracts offered in evidence; and because the position and doctrines of the defendant church is stated in the bill and is admitted by the plaintiff, and are not at issue in this case". The preface of Exhibit "W", offered in evidence from pages 3, 4, and 5 there of, is in words and figures as follows,- to wit,- PREFACE In presenting this little volume before the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, it is hoped that due allowances will be made; for in treating upon a subject so disgusting to every feeling of virtue, and so palably absurd as the doctrine of polygamy, which is taught and practiced by Brigham Young and his party, would seem to every chase and reflecting mind to need no comment in proof of its falsity. But the wretched perversions of good and holy principles, feigned by the misapplication of sacred Scripture, so as to decay the minds of many to credit their sophistry; and seeing the calamitous train of evils that so base apostasy has brought upon this people, and feeling for the welfare of this church, and knowing that such a system of whoredoms is wholly unauthorized in the doctrine given for a foundation of faith and practice in this church, and is down right perversion of her laws and and an imposition upon the members; therefore seeing the great necessity of a defense being made in support of the true principles as given to the church in the beginning; and also the frequent solicitations to the same by my brethern, which has induced me to present an exposition of their abominable doctrines of whoredoms as found in their own standard publication of that apostate division, of which Brigham Young holds the Presidency; and those references and quotations that I have given in this work is but a small portion of apostate doctrines that is found in their own standard works. But let the candid reader compare their doctrine with the standard of truth, and he need not be at a loss to perceive that it is postively and certainly false". The book of Mormon referred to in this work is of the third edition, (-Nauvoo, Illinois) and also the book of doctrine and Covenants of the second European edition, -Liverpool. The remarks that are presented on the subject of priesthood and church organization is not pretended to be full and complete, in containing all that might be profitably introduced on this all, and infinately important subject' but is briefly presented i as plain and simple manner as is practicable with its author, endeavoring to observe that style of simplicity that would be plain and easy to the understanding of all who may read; and that sufficiency is given to guard off all imposition, and to establish every mind in regard to the true order of the Presidency. I will here present a mirror for Brigham Young to behold himself in, and all his doings; and also of all his followers as found in the book of Mormon, P. 17,-Book of Mosiah, 7th chap. "And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his stead, and he did 612 not walk in the ways of his father. For behold he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own heart. And he had many wifes and concubines. And did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickednes. And he laid a tax on one fifth part on all they possessed; a fifth part of their gold and of their silver, and a fifth part of their ziff, and of their copper and of their brass and of their iron, and a fifth part of the fatlings; and also a fifth par of their grain. And all this did he take to support him and his wives, and his concubines; thus he had changed the affairs of the kingdom. For he put down all the priests that had been consecrated by his father, and consecrated new ones in their stead, such as were lifted up in the pride of their hearts. Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, and in their whoredoms by the taxes King Noah had put upon his people; thus did the people labor exceedingly, to support iniquity. Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were deceived by the vain and flattering words of the priests, - for they did speak flattering things unto them". By Mr. Traber, - "We now offer in evidence from Exhibit "W", that portion of page thirteen which begins with the pronoun "I" in the ninth line, and ending with the words "but do" on the first line of page fourteen. Also that portion beginning with the word "was" in the eighth line from the bottom of page fifteen, and ending with the word "God" in the second line of page seventeen. Also that portion beginning with the word "now" near the middle of the page on page nineteen, and ending with the words "from it" in the fourteenth line from the top of page twenty three inclusive. Also beginning with the "now" in the eighth line from the top of page ninety two, and ending with the word "apostacy" in the seventh line from the bottom of the same page". By Mr. Southern, - "I make the same objection on behalf of the defendants as were made to the lst offer of proof, - the same objection applies to these offers of proof, - and the objection is made simply because of the irrelevancy of the matter offered, and for the other reasons given without reference to the truth or falsity of what is stated in these extraction". The extract from exhibit "W" above offered in evidence from page thirteen, is in words and figures as follows, to to wit, - "I Make mention of these publications for the benefit of those who have not yet seen their writings on the subject of polygamy, or the Spiritual wife system, that many of the brethern in this part of the country would not credit such culumniating reports, at first wishing something better to befall their persecuted
    brethern, but also it is true that they both teach and practice the doctrine of polygamy in the most wicked and degrading manner at the Salt Lake valley; and they are not publishing their nefarious doctrines in the most impudent manner to all the civilized world, and their abominable traffic in such poluted doctrines is distined to bring down the vengeance of the just God or Heaven upon heads of all those who hold fellowship with such apostate doctrines, and it is high time that the pure in heart take some special measures for their deliverence from the awful crash of destructions which in hanging over the heads of the apostates of the Church of Jesus Christ, and spedily step forward upon the rock of deliverence and plan of salvation, which is the Book of Mormon, Bible and Doctrine and Covenants which the saints must come to, and not only say but do". The extract above offered in evidence from Exhibit "W" on page fifteen, is in words and figures a follows to wit, - "Was the book of Mormon 613 and Bible and book Covenants to be the rock and pilliar of their faith, for the foundation of the church which was organized on the 6th day of April 1830, and was these three inspired books to be a standard for the people of God? Yes, this position it true, and cannot be controverted by any man or set of men. Then Joseph organized the church on that rock or plan of salvation, as contained in those three inspired books. This was the identical great work that Joseph was called to do. Do you, believe this? If you do, can you say that any of the parties, as they now stand, are built upon that foundation that the apostles and prophets had laid, as is contained in those three inspired books? Remember it is the things written in those books, -it is the doctrine contained in those inspired books, written by the inspired prophets and apostles of the Son of God, that this Church of Jesus Christ was founded and organized upon by Joseph Smith Oliver Cowdery, and Joseph Smith Jr., were the first elders of this church; they preached and administered unto others those identical doctrines in that perfect sameness who became members, and also some elders of this identical church of Jesus Christ, whose principles of doctrine, of laws, of church rules, and regulations, of Gospel precepts, of faith, of hope of charity of piety virtue, meekness, patience, temperance, chastity, courage, godliness, and of all things that is needful for the man of God, that he may be thoroughly furnished with every good word and work in Jesus Christ, is the doctrine contains in these books. The order of the doctrine of the priesthood to Joseph, and from Joseph to the church, and that too, for the last time, and the ordaining of high priests, Elders Teachers, deacons, etc. have been done and performed by that man of God, who was called to lay the foundation of that great work in the book of Covenants we have the order of the priest hood, the records of Joseph's labors and many revelations, blessed by God". The extract from exhibit "W", above offered in evidence from page nineteen, is in words and figures as follows, to wit,-"Now as it has fallen to my lot to take up ,y pen and vindicate the cause of truth as it is in the Church of Jesus Christ, as established in these last days by that man of God, Joseph Smith, who was called and inspired to lay the foundation anew for the only identical church of Jesus Christ (since all others have apostatized in omitting some of the doctrines and commandments of God, and substituting the commandments and precepts of men for doctrine, thereby apostatizing themselves from the true faith of the lamb of God;) and that the church of Jesus Christ being established again anew, upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, of the Son of God, on the 6th day of April A. D. 1830, embracing the doctrine contained in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and book of Doctrine and Covenants for their faith and practice. These three above named inspired volumes was received by the whole church of Christ as established and again by Joseph Smith, to be the rock, and pillar and ground work of their faith and doctrine in Jesus Christ; hence we have the foundation of this church before us, of which I profess to be a member Now brothern, every where in the wold, where-ever you may be, allow me to appeal to you and your consciences, in all candor, honesty and fairness, before God, whom you have professed to love and obey, and by whom you will be judged, according to his written word, ti is not an apostacy to depart from the principles of the doctrine that is contained in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Book of Doctrine and Covenants given in the foundation of this church, for her faith, rules and practice? I ask you, is it not an apostacy to depart from those sacred things given from heaven, by the God of heaven for our salvation? What say ye? O 614 reader, reflect and think before it is too late, and see whether you are certainly right. Now, brethern, you have for a long time preached to the various protestant churches, concerning their apostacy, showing that they have apostatized from the primitive order of the gospel; showing that there was none of them legally the true and identical church of Jesus Christ. How did you do this? You showed them that they were not built upon the principles of the gospel as taught by the apostles, and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, - as contained in the bible. The New Testament part in particular; that they did not teach and practice according to that sacred book, which was all they had, - which contains the writings of the apostles, and the sayings of our Savior Jesus Christ. This sacred volume then, was the standard to try the different faiths, creeds and disiplines by; then according to the things written in that sacred book, the Holy Bible you put the whole test, - saying, (to the law, and to the testimony, if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them, - Isiah -8-20) this, brethern, was often your text, are you now as ready and as willing as ever to quote the same? That sacred book, the Bible, then was the substance of your text; and the law and testimony to which you wished to bring your disputant to be tried by. Now, suppose they, your sectarian friends, has suceeded in proving their doctrines to be precisely according to the bible, would they not have been right? Most assuredly they would. And how would you have proven them wrong, unless by the bible, as you made that a test book? But they did not prove their doctrine to be all precisely according to the bible; therefore, you proceeded and proved their doctrine was not all precisely acording to the bible, and that they were not wholly founded upon the bible. "Look that thou make them after their pattern, which was showed them in the Mount". Exodus 25, 40. Again; "See, saith he, that thou make all thing according to the pattern shown to thee in the Mount". Heb. - 8 - 5. If they speak not according to the word of the Lord God, it is because there is no light in them, therefore, inasmuch as they could not prove that they were precisely founded and built upon the doctrine of the apostles and prophets, you declared they were in a state of apostacy, and proceeded to prove it. How did you do it? Well, I will tell you, fiends, how you done it, or could have done it easy. You proceeded to prove that they committed some of the commandments of God, given for their salvation, which was essential. You showed that some of the ordinances they did not perform aright, according to the gospel pattern. You also proved by showing that they had substituted the opinions and commandments of men for doctrines; and in many respects, now having done as well as they know how; therefore, you showed that they were not built upon the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the apostles, according to the Holy Scriptures, which was given for the foundation of the Saints of God; therefore, you proved that they were not built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets; consequently, they were plainly shown to be in a state of apostacy, because they had departed from the right way. Now, brethern, this is the way you used to threat the sectarian world, whenever you found a departure from a scriptural order of things you cried out apostacy, man of sin, - fallen people, - all in the dark, etc. Now brethern, let us turn in the scales and examine the other side, is it right that a people should be examined as to their faith and practice? and also that they should examine them selves? Even if it should turn out that some of you, brethern, have departed also from the faith, and the practice of your profession, as you first were taught, and recorded. You first record the book of Mormon and the bible and book of Covenants to practice and build upon the sacred thing written in those inspired 615 books. This was your faith at the first. Have you departed from the sacred order of things, which was laid for the foundation of your faith in Jesus Christ? I ask you, have yo departed from it? The following is the extract offered in evidence from page ninety two of said exhibit "W", in words and figures, to wit, - "Now if any one should desire further proof in regard to the things given for a standard and foundation of this church, just turn and read the 28 to 33 pages in this work. There you will find proof positive, showing plainly that the doctrine contained in those three inspired volumes, were given to this church for a code of laws, to govern and regulate all matters and affairs in this church, whatever, and to be a standard for the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Hence brethern, I presume we have it plain before us, relative to the subject of the foundation of this church, and I have also shown that the Spiritual wife system is a departure from the foundation and standard of faith and doctrine uponwhich this church was first founded and built
    up in; also that this departure is a heresy, and that those who wee engaged in the practice of polygamy are in an awful wicked state of apostacy". By Mr. E.L. Kelley, - "Plaintiff offers in evidence the book "Journal of Discourses," identified by the witness Brackenbury and marked exhibit "One"; and on page 50 we introduce all that part in the second column beginning with the word "now" on the ninth line, and extending to the word "sucession" in the first line of the first column on page fifty one, being the apostasy with reference to God being incorporated in the doctrine of the faction that went to Utah in 1847 under the leadership of Brigham Young. Also on page eighty three in the column all that part beginning in the fourteenth from the bottom of the page, with the words "I say", and extending to the bottom of the page, showing the manner of dealing with apostates; also on page one hundred and sixty one in the second column, beginning with the fifteenth line from the top of the page, and extending to the fourth line from the top of the first column on page one hundred and sixty two." By Mr. Southern, - "All of which is objected to because it is immeterial irrelevant and incompetent. It is irrelevant to any issue or matter pertaining to this case in any manner, and because the extracts offered in evidence purport to be only extracts from a book, - and there is nothing to show they are expressive of the opinion, or doctrine of any faction or church, - that nothing has been shown prior to their introduction or is shown now, to identify them as the deliverence of the party to whom they are credited." By Mr. E.L. Kelley, - "I think this was done, but if it was not I will now offer the title page of this work entitle "Journal of Discourses by Brigham Young, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. His two Counsellors, the twelve Apostles and others. Reported by G.D. Watt, and humbly dedicated to the Latter Day Saints in all the world. Volume 1. Liverpool., Published by F.D. and S.W. Richards, 15 Wilton Street. London., Latter Day Saints Book Depot, 35 Jewin Street City. 128 1854", with the introduction of the matter on page fifty that was first offered, and also offer the following as a hearing of of the discourse in which that language occurs "A Sermon delivered by President Brigham Young in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, April 9th 1852." Accompanying and going with the offer at matter on page eight three, beginning with the second column, I also offer the heading as it is printed in the same work as follows, - "An address delivered by President Brigham Young in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City. March 27th 1853". 616 In connection with that part offered from page one hundred and sixty one, I offer the heading as follows, - "And address deliverd by President Heber C. Kimball, in the Tabernacle Great Salt Lake City, October 9th 1852, at the general conference". All are found in the same exhibit marked "one". By Mr. Southern, - "All of which are objected to for the reasons to be found in the objects to the last offer of proof, and for the further reason that what is offered is not even second rate hear say testimony offered and for the further reason that the testimony offered does not purport to be or to show authoritively the belief and the doctrine of any church organization connected directly or indirectly with the controversy in this case". The following is that part of the exhibit referred to as exhibit "one" introduced in evidence from page fifty, in words and figures, to wit, - Now hear it, O inhabitants of the earth Jew and Gentile, Saint and Sinner. When our gather Adam came into the Garden of Eden, he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is Michael and Archangel, the Ancient of Days about whom holy men have written and spoken, - He is our father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do. Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear it, and will know it sooner or later. They came here, organized the raw material and arranged in their order the herbs of the field, the trees the apple, the peach, the plum, the pear, and every other fruit that is desireable and good for man; the seed was brought from another sphere and planted in this earth. The thistle, the thorn, the briar, and the obnoxious weed, did not appear until after the earth was cursed. When Adam and Eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit, their bodies became mortal from its affects, and therefore their offsprings were mortal. When the Virgin Mary concieved the child Jesus, the Father had begotten him in his own likeness. He was not begotten by the Holy Gost. And who is the Father? He is the first of the human family; and when he took a tabernacle it was begotten by his Father in Heaven, after the same manner as the tabernacles of Cain, Abel, and the rest of the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve; from the fruits of the earth, the first earthly tabernacles were originated by the Father, and so on in sucession". The following is that part of the exhibit referred to as exhibit "one" introduced in evidence from page eighty three, in words and figures, wit, - "rather than that apostates should flourish here, I will unsheath my bowie knife and conquer or die. (Great commotion in the congregation and a simultaneous burst of feelings assenting to the declaration.) Now you nasty apostates clear out, or judgement will be put to the line, and righteousness to the plummet. (Voices, generally, - "go it", "Go it",) If you lay it is right raise your hands. (All hands up) Let us call upon the Lord to assist us in this, and every good work. The following is the part of the exhibit referred to as "one" offered in evidence on the part of the plaintiff, in words an figures to wit, - (found on page one hundred and sixty one) "What need you care where you go, if you go according to direction, and when you get to Coal Creek or Iron County, be subject to that man who is placed there to rule you, just the same as you would be subject to President Young if you were here, because that man is delegated by this Conference, and sanntioned by this people, and that man's word is law, and so it is with the Bishops; they are our fathers our goveners, and we are their household. It is for them to provide for their household, and watch over them and govern and control them; they are potters to mould you,

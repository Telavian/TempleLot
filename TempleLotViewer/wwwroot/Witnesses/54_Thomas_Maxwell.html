  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness and the answer of the witness regarding this piece of ground described; for the reason that it is hearsay, incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and does not refer to the property in controversy, and does refer to that property about which there is no question as to its belonging to the plaintiffs, if the plaintiffs claim it belongs to them, and moves the court to strike the answer of the witness from the record from that reason.</mono>

  <question>Mr Maxwell is it not true that that stone fence which you have spoken of, was on the south side of Walnut street, and extended from Temple street east to the north east corner of Chrisman's property?</question>
  <answer>It might have been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>119</questionnumber>

  <answer>No sir, but I think it was down here on Lexington street. I think it was down where I said it was.</answer>

  <questionnumber>122</questionnumber>
  <question>What kind of a fence was that?</question>
  <answer>It was a stone or rock fence. I remember well enough that it was down here running along the road, and when a man has the experience I had with it he is not likely to forget it you know. I remember being behind it with a gun he knows he was there, and that was my experience for I know it was a stone fence and made a pretty good be east work. Now I know that as well as I can know anything.</answer>

  <questionnumber>125</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now is it not true Mr Maxwell that the stone fence along what is now known as the Lexington road or street, - street or road which ever it is called, - commenced at or near what is known as the Pacific Bridge, and extended along the south side of the road to about the point where St John street is now as designated on the map, and then ran directly east?</question>
  <answer>No sir. It ran further than that. From my knowledge of it it rad about to - that point there (indicating a point on plat).</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>126</questionnumber>
  <question>About to Walnut street it ran?</question>

  <question>Was there any fence at Lexington street at the point where it intersects Walnut and from that to Temple Street, on the south side of Walnut?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I think there was.</answer>
  <question>Well was there?</question>
  <answer>I think there was, but of course I don't remember very well about that. I can't remember these things they were so long ago and I did not pay any particular attention to the matter at the time. Of course it was a stone fence that was there along Lexington street, - there is no doubt of that, for it would be a dogged fool that would build a fence like that any where else but along the road. Now I think there was a fence there where you say, but I can't say whether it was a stone fence or not. It might have been but I hardly think any one would built a stone fence there. If the fight had been done there instead of where it did, and the road run down there instead of where it did, and the road run down there instead of where it did I might remember more about it than I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>130</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not true that when you were behind that stone fence fighting the Federals that you were in this Chrisman field?</question>
  <answer>No sir we were right there along the road. I would not be such a dogged fool as not to know when we were off the road. That is where we were, and we were behind the stone fence too. I would not be such a dogged fool as not to remember that. You would remember it I will bet you if you had been there. I know where I was.</answer>

  <question>No sir I don't say that you did, but I want to get it right now. Do you say now that you ever saw any houses built on any of these lots from fifiteen to twenty two?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't say so now, and I did not say so then. I don't think there has ever been a house built on any of those lots, - only there is a little church built there now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>134</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>136</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see any fence enclosing these lots or either of them, at any time prior to the time that the fence that is not surrounding them was built?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not say. I don't remember that I ever saw a fence enclosing them particularly. As I told Mr. Southern I could not say positively as to that, but where. As I think over it it seems to me that there was, but when it comes to swearing positively as to it, I can't say that I do remember seeing a fence there, and I will not swear to anything positively without I know it positively.</answer>

  <question>Well was there, - do you recollect of any fence near there except the one that you recollect being along the south side of Walnut street, there along the road here? I mean along Lexington Avenue and Walnut street?</question>

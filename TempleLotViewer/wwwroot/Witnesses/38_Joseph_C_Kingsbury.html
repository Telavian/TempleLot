  <answer>The revelation, - Bishop Whitney got the revelation when we were married and presented it to me and wanted me to copy it, and so I went into a room by myself, - a divided place, - a place that was divided, - I went off in there by myself, and copied it, - that is I copied the revelation on plural marriage that he handed me, and just as I got through the copying of it, Hyrum Smith came in and wanted the revelation, - the original revelation, was what he wanted. He came in to see how I got along with it, - That is Bishop Whitney did, and then he went out and told Hyrum Smith that he would hand him the revelation in a few minutes, for I was not quite through the copying of it. Well when I got through making the copy, I took the one I had made myself and read it and he took the original and read it at the same time to see if I had made any mistakes, and that it was correct, and when he found that it was all correct he took the one that the one that I had made and went out to the door and handed it to Hyrum Smith who was outside of the door ready to take it.</answer>

  <questionnumber>29</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to look at that book to refresh your memory, and then state to the reporter about what year that was? That is what year it was that you made that copy of the revelation you have stated you made?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question on the ground that it is leading, and improper, incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, examination.</mono>
  <answer>I copied it the same year it was given. I did not notice it particularly as to the date and I can't say, and I can't see this very well. At all events it was about the middle of July that I made the copy, - July of the same year it was given, - and possibly the same day it was given, - I can't say as to that, but I don't think it was more than a day or two after it was given, - at any rate I made the copy of it right away shortly after it was given. (witness refers to the book handed him) I think it was in 1843, - any way it was the same year it was given that I copied it, and it was not more than two or three days after it was given that I copied it.</answer>

  <questionnumber>76</questionnumber>
  <question>And finally got to Nauvoo in 1840 or 1841, - which was it?</question>
  <answer>Well it was before that probably. I got thee in the winter or fall of 1839 I guess it was, for I stopped at Quincy you know for a while before I went there. I went up to Far West I think in '40. Anyway I got there late in '39 at Nauvoo or in the beginning of '40, - but I could not say whether I got there in '39 or not for sure.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't mean you were at Far West in 1840?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>78</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is what you said?</question>
  <answer>Well that is wrong for I got to Far West in October 1838 and then I was obliged to leave there in 1839 the time that the most of the rest left there, and I went on down to about twenty or twenty five miles from Quincy where I stopp r for eight or nine months, and then I went on to Quincy and stopped there for a little while and then I went on to Nauvoo, and got there probably in the latter part of '39 or the early part of '40, - I don't know which.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>79</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it was a mistake when you said you went to Far West in '40?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - I don't think I said that. If I did it was in answer to one of your questions, and I thought it was Nauvoo you were talking about.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>80</questionnumber>
  <question>Well don't your answer show that you went up to Far West in 1840?</question>

  <questionnumber>531</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>Well I mean that there was nothing more said about it then than there had been before, until just a year or so before Joseph's death, and then it began to be talked about.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>532</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the law of marriage was the law laid down and declared upon by the church in the book of doctrine and Covenants, which at that time was the edition of 1835?</question>

  <answer>I understand what it reads so, - that a woman should have but one husband.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>537</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you say that is what it is?</question>
  <answer>I think so, but whatever is in the book is right. I haven't read it for a long time, and memory is not as good on that as it used to be, but I think that is what it says.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>538</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recollect whether or not this was apart of the church law when you were out as a minister before 1844, - don't you recollect that this was a part of the church law?</question>
  <answer>Well read it, and let me see?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>539</questionnumber>
  <question>I will read from Exhibit "E", paragraph seven, section thirteen, being the revelation given in Februrary 1831, "And again I say thou shalt not kill; but he that killeth shall die. Thou shalt not steal, and he that stealeth and will not repent, shall be cast out. Thou shalt not lie; he that lieth and will not repent shall be cast out. Thou shalt love they wife with all they heart, and shall cleave unto her, and none else; and he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her, shall deny the faith and shall not have the Spirit, and if he repents not he shall be cast out. Thou shalt not commit adultery; and he that commiteth adultery and repents not shall be cast out; but he that commiteth adultery and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive; but if he doeth it again he shall not be forgiven, but shall be cast out. Thou shalt not speak evil of they neighbor, nor do him any harm. Thou knowest my laws concerning these things are given in my scriptures; he that sinneth and repenteth not, shall be cast out". You recollect that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>540</questionnumber>
  <question>You recollect that as the law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is right. That is there of course, and I recollect it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>541</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that not a law of the church when you were a minister in the church prior to 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that was one of the articles of the church sir, - at least I suppose it was considered so in those days. What year was that?</answer>

  <question>Do you suppose this was not publicly printed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>547</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it that was not printed?</question>
  <answer>The revelation was not printed at the time it was given to the church. It was printed since that time. You see the book of the law and commandments was not printed at the time it was given to the church, the revelations were not printed as fast as they were given to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>548</questionnumber>
  <question>When were they first published?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember that date, but all the commandments or revelations that were given were printed in the first book that was published after they were given, that is the commandments or revelations that were given up to that time.</answer>

  <answer>Well no, for we considered that by revelation or commandment we had the privilege of having more than one wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>563</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that a commandment or revelation changing this law here?</question>
  <answer>Well yes sir, not changing that law but adding to it, you might say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>564</questionnumber>
  <question>Adding to it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>565</questionnumber>
  <question>Did the addition make a change in the law?</question>

  <question>Well can't she be sealed to two different ones?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't see how she can be. That is not my understanding of the law. If tht is the law I don't know it, for I don't see how she could be.</answer>

  <answer>Yes sir, that was what was taught when we came here first, that was what was taught when we came here that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>895</questionnumber>
  <question>If you had joined the Disciples church at that time, or at any other time would you have been baptized into that church?</question>

  <questionnumber>902</questionnumber>
  <question>If you had been baptized by the Congregational Church, or the Methodist church, or by any other church except this one here, wouldn't it have made void your original baptism?</question>
  <answer>Well I consider it would be made void any way, it would be void any way, and if it was void if I baptized or was baptized I don't think there would be any particular virtue in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>903</questionnumber>
  <question>What is that, I don't understand that?</question>
  <answer>I say that I don't consider that there was any particular virtue in the baptism out here, it was simply done for out satisfaction, and not because we considered that there was any particular virtue in it. We had come over a long weary way, and had met with many a hardship, and had went through many things to test our temper and some of us we felt might have fallen into sin by the way, and so the baptism here was simply something that was done in view of correcting anything of that kind. It was not necessary in the case of any one who had kept his faith pure, and had not fallen into sin at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>904</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you considered when you got here that your original baptism was void?</question>

    Counsel for the defendants objects to the question the witness on the ground and for the reasons that it is not the best evidence. By Mr. P.P. Kelly,-"We desire that the alleged revelation to be found on page 463 of Defendants exhibit "A", and being section one hundred and thirty two be copied into the record in connection with the evidence of this witness, for the purpose of showing how much of it there is. Counsel for the defendants objects to the revelation above referred to being copied in the record, for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and moves the court to strike the same from the record in case it is copied, and tax the cost for coping same against the plaintiff. The revelation above referred to, is in words and figures as follows, to wit,- Section 132 Revelation on the eternity-of the Marriage Covenant, including the Plurality of Wives, Given through Joseph the Seer, In Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois, July 12th 1843. I Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph, that in-as-much as you have inquired of my hand, to know and understand where in, I, the Lord justified my servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; as also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants as

    </pagenumber>of their having many wives and concubines; 2 Behold, and lo, I am the Lord they God, and will answer thee- as touching this matter. 3 Wherefore prepare they heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same. 4 Q - For behold, I reveal unto you a new and everlasting covenant; and no man can reject this covenant, and be permitted to enter into my glory; 5 For all who will have a blessing at my hands, shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world. 6 And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth the fulness thereof, must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God. 7 And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law, are these; - All covenents, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into, and sealed, by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is annointed, but as well for time, and for all eternity, and that too most holy by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine annointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power, (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time, on whom this power, and the keys of this priesthood is conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue or force, in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto-this end, have an end when men are dead. 8 Behold mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion. 9 Will I accept of an offering, saith the Lord, that is not made in my name, 10 Or will I receive at your hands that which I have not appointed. 11 And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord, except it be by law, even as I, and my father ordained unto you, before the world was, 12 I am the Lord they God, and I give unto you this commandment, that no man shall come unto the Father, but by me, or by my word, which is my law saith the Lord, 13 And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men by thrones or principalities, or powers, or or things of name, whatsoever they may be, that are not by my word, saith the Lord shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your God. 14 For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things are not by me, shall be shaken and destroyed. 15 Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me, nor by my word; and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world, and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law, when they are out of the world; 16 Therefore, when they are out of the world, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory; 17 For these angels did not abide by law, therefore they cannot be enlarged, but remain seperately and singly, without exaltation in their saved condition, to all eternity, and from henceforth are not Gods but are angels of God for ever and ever. 233 18 And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me, or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, through him who I have annointed and appointed unto this power - - then it is not valid, neither of force when they are outside of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word, when they are out of the world, it cannot be received there , because the angels and the Gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot therefore, inherit my glory, for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God. 19 And again, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is annointed, unto whom I have appointed this power, and the keys of this Priesthood; and it shall be said unto them, ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths - - then shall it be written in the Lambs Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in my covenant, and committ no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them in time, and through all eternity, and shall be full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels and the Gods which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds for ever and ever. 20 Then shall they be Gods, for they have no end; therefore shall they be from ever lasting to ever lasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be Gods because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them. 21 Verily, verily, I say unto you, except you abide my law, ye cannot attain to this glory. 22 For straight is the gate and narrow the way that leadeth unto exaltation and continuation of the lives, and a few there be that find it, because ye receive me not in the world, neither do you know me. 23 But if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and receive your exaltation, that where I am, ye shall be also, 24 This is eternal lives, to know the only wise and true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. I am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law. 25 Broad is the gate and wide the way that leadeth to the deaths, and many there are that go in thereat; because they receive me not, neither do they abide in my law. 26 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she shall commit an sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder, wherein they shed innocent blood, yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter unto their exaltation; but they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God. 27 The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the world, or out of the world, is that ye commit murder, wherein ye shed innocent blood, 234 and assent unto my death, after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law, can in no wise enter into my glory, but shall be damned, saith the Lord. 28 I am the Lord they God, and will give unto thee the law of my Holy Priesthood, as was ordained by me, and my Father before the world was. 29 Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandment, by my word saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation, and sitteth upon his throne. 30 Abraham received promises concerning his seed, and of the fruit of his loins, -- from whose loins ye are, namely, my servant Joseph, - which were to continue so long as they were in the world they should continue; both in the world and out of the world shall they continue as innumerable as the stars; or if ye were to count the sand upon the sea shore, ye could not number them. 31 This promise is your, also, because, ye are of Abraham, and the promise was made unto Abraham; and by this law are the continuation of works of my Father, wherein he glorifieth himself. 32 Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham; enter ye into my law, and ye shall be saved. 33 But if ye enter not into my law ye cannot receive the promise of my Father, which he made unto Abraham. 34 God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to wife. And why did she do it? Because this was the law, and from Hagar sprang many people. This therefore, was fulfilling, among other things, the promises. 35 Was Abraham therefore, under condemnation? Verily, I say unto you, nay; for I the Lord commanded it. 36 Abraham was commanded to offer his son Isaac, nevertheless it was written, thou shalt not kill. Abraham, however did not refuse, and it was accounted unto-him for righteousness. 37 Abraham received concubines, and they bear him children, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in my law, as Isaac also, and Jacob did none other things than that which they were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are Gods. 38 David's wives and concubines were given unto him of me by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me, save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world; for I gave them unto another; saith the Lord. 39 (This verse is missing) 40 I am the Lord they God, and I gave unto thee my servant Joseph, an appointmelt, and restore all things; ask what ye will, and it shall be given unto
    you according to my word. 41 And as ye have asked concerning adultery, - verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the Holy annointing, she hath committed adultery, and shall be destroyed. 235 42 If she e not in the new and everlasting covenant, and she be with another man, she hath committed adultery. 43 And if her husband be with another woman, and he was under a vow, he hath broken his vow, and committed adultery. 44 And if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent, and hath not broken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto her, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood, to take her and give her unto him that hath not committed adultery, but hath been faithful; for he shall be made ruler over many. 45 For I have conferred upon you the keys and power of the Priesthood, wherein I restore all things, and make known unto you all things in due time. 46 And, verily, verily, I say unto you, that what-so-ever you seal on earth, shall be sealed in Heaven; and what-so-ever you bind on earth in my name, and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens; and what-so-ever sins you remit on earth, shall be remitted eternally in the heavens; and what-so-ever sins you retain on earth shall be retained in heaven. 47 And again, verily, I say unto you, what-so-ever you bless, I will bless, and what-so-ever you curse I will curse, saith the Lord, for I the Lord, am they God. 48 And again, verily I say unto you, my servant Joseph, that what-so-ever you give on earth, and to whom-so-ever you give on earth, and to whom-so-ever you give any one on earth, by my word and according to my law, it shall be visited with blessings, and not cursings and with my power saith the Lord, and shall be without condemnation on earth, and in heaven. 49 For I am the Lord they God, and will be with thee even to the end of the world, and through all eternity; for verily I seal unto you your exaltation, and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my Father, with Abraham, your Father. 50 Behold I have seen your sacrifices, and will forgive all your sings; I have seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which I told you; go, therefore, and I make a way for your escape, as I accepted the offering of Abraham, of his son Isaac. 51 Verily, I say unto you, a commandment I given unto my handmaid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, that she stay herself, and partake not-of that which I commanded you to offer her; for I did it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham; and that I might require an offering at your hand, by covenant and sacrifice; 52 And let mine hand maid Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my-servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God. 53 For I am the Lord they God, and ye shall obey my voice; and I give unto my servant Joseph that he shall be made a ruler over many things for he hath been faithful over a few things, and from henceforth I will strengthen him; 54 And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment, she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord they God; and will destroy her, if she abide not in my law. 55 But if she will now abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply him, and give unto him an hundred fold in this world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal words. 56 And again verily I say, let mine hand maid forgive my servant Joseph 236 his trespasses; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord they God, will bless her, and multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice. 57 And again I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy; for I am the Lord, they God (two lines on top of each other, I can't make them out) and glory. 58 Now, as touching the law of the Priesthood, there are many things pertaining thereunto. 59 Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was Aaron by mine own voice, and by the voice of him that sent me, and I have endowed him with the keys of the power of this Priesthood, if he do anything in my name, and according to my law, and by my word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify him. 60 Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph, for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I required at his hands for his transgressions saith the Lord your God. 61 And again as pertaining to the law of the Priesthood: if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent; and if he espouse the second and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given until him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth to him, and to no one else. 62 And if he have ten virgins given until him by this law, he cannot commit adultery for they belong until him, and they are given unto him, therefore, is he justified. 63 But if one, or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man,; she has committed adultery and shall be destroyed for they are given until him to multiply and replenish the earth according to my commandment, and to fulfill the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world; and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for therein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified. 64 And again, verily, verily I say unto you, if any man have a wife which holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my Priesthood, as pertaining these things, thel shall she believe, and administer unto him, or she shall be destroyed saith the Lord your God, for I will destroy her; for I will magnify my name on all those who receive and abide in my law. 65 Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all things, whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not administer unto him according to my word; and then she becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the law, when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife. 66 And now as pertaining to this law, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will reveal more unto you hereafter, therefore, let this suffice for the present. Behold I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.

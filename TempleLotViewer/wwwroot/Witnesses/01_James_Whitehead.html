I knew that he had been ordained, and was ordained and set apart by his father as successor in the office of the head of the church, and he came out and made that proclamation to the saints in mass, and they received it. Now that is the reason I came back to the church, for I always believed in its teaching and intended to go back to it again when the right time would come, as I knew it would some time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>236</questionnumber>
  <question>At what time did he do that?</question>
  <answer>In 1843.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>237</questionnumber>
  <question>Then how is it you did not belong to this church sooner that 1865?</question>
  <answer>Because he did not take his place until 1860. He was but a boy, and when he was ordained he was not to take his place until the Lord called him, and he did not do it until then, so it was in 1860 when he took his place in obedience to the call of the Lord.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>238</questionnumber>

  <question>The gentlemen who is now that President of the Re-organized Church of Latter Day Saints?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I know what you mean, - what do you want to know about it?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>247</questionnumber>
  <question>You say he was ordained at the time, - or in the winter of 1843 is that correct?</question>

  <answer>Well that was in "60, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>249</questionnumber>

  <answer>He was about twelve years old.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>250</questionnumber>
  <question>And he was ordained in the year 1843 was he?</question>
  <answer>I could not say it might have been early in the year of 1844, -it was near that time.

  <question>The redords started for there, but you don't know whether they ever reached Salt Lake or not? Is that what you mean?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir they started there, but if they got there or not I don't know, for I was not with them. I can't say what became of them after they left my hands.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>253</questionnumber>
  <question>Now what were the circumstances of that ordination?</question>
  <answer>I can't tell you. What do you mean? What do you mean by that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>254</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I mean this, - You stated in your examination in chief that Joseph Smith was ordained by his father in pursuance of a revelation which he had received?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>255</questionnumber>
  <question>A revelation from God?</question>
  <answer>That is so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>256</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then I want to enquire as to how you know he received a revelation from God?</question>
  <answer>I know it, - I know it was from God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>257</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know it?</question>
  <answer>I know it because I had it in my hand and read it. It was handed to me, and I use to take care of these things.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>258</questionnumber>
  <question>How was it handed to you?</question>
  <answer>By Joseph.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>259</questionnumber>

  <question>This revelation was handed to you, written out?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, Joseph handed it to me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>262</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then I will repeat my question and ask you how you know it was a revelation from God?</question>
  <answer>How do you know that that bible is true? How do you know the testament is true, - answer me that? I believe what the testament teaches me that if we are to live aright we have to have the Spirit of God and of the Holy Ggost the Comforter, that searcheth all things, - even the deep things of God, and makes it manifest of the children of God.</answer>

    </pagenumber>by Joseph Smith senior, was the revelation of God?
  </question>
  <answer>Well I am convinced and satisfied of it just the same as I am convinced and satisfied that the Bible is a revelation from God. I know it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>265</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, you must have some reasons for knowing it?</question>
  <answer>I had reasons. I knew that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and I knew that Joseph Smith would not say that he had received a revelation from God if he had not. Look at the revelations in the book of Covenants there, and they are in perfect harmony with the Bible and Book of Mormon; and every revelation he ever gave is in perfect harmony with it, and I am bound to believe that it is in harmony with that, and I can't help believing that, but if they were not in harmony with that I would reject it at once. I know sir that Joseph Smith was a true prophet, and his revelations were from God, and I know that as well as I know anything on earth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>266</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know how a revelation is received?</question>
  <answer>How what is received?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>267</questionnumber>
  <question>How a revelation is received?</question>
  <answer>Well he had the Urim and Thimmim I suppose, just as they had it in the ancient days. Now sir that is my faith and I know it too, although you may scoff at it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>268</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he have the Urim and Thummim?</question>
  <answer>He did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>269</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know it?</question>
  <answer>Because I have seen it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>270</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it?</question>
  <answer>I will not tell you what it is. You must search the Bible, for it is not for me to describe these things. He translated the Book of Mormon though that, and it is not for me or anyone else to tell you what it is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>272</questionnumber>
  <question>Why do you decline to tell me what the Urim and Thummim is?</question>
  <answer>It is a gift of God, an instrument of the Lord that he gives to his servants and prophets.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>273</questionnumber>
  <question>It is?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>274</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know it is?</question>
  <answer>Why don't he say so in the Bible?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>275</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then go ahead and describe it?</question>
  <answer>Now I will just ask you a question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>276</questionnumber>
  <question>No, no, you are not the one who is asking questions now. I am asking you questions, you are not telling me these things for me to believe, for I may know all about it, but you are telling them for the information of the Judge of the United States Circuit Court?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't mean to tell things to people that ridicule them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>277</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I made an explaination before I commenced these examinations as to my motives in this examination, and I thought we understood each other, and just see the trouble I have got into?</question>
  <answer>Well I think you are going out of your latitude.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. E.L. Kelley,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>278</questionnumber>
  <question>Well answer his questions Uncle Whitehead, if you can, and if you cannot why say so?</question>
  <answer>I cannot answer that question better than I have done already.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>279</questionnumber>
  <question>Well answer this question if you are pleased to do so, what is the Urim and Thummim?</question>
  <answer>Well Moses had the Urim and Thummim and the breastplate, and the rod of heaven, you know that for you can read it in the Bible as well as I can.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>280</questionnumber>
  <question>Well sir the Circuit Judge of the United States Court, before whom this testimony will go will probably want to know something about that, and I do not know how he can find out unless I can get it from the testimony of men who have seen it?</question>
  <answer>There are hundreds and thousands of men who have read that Bible and they know what it is. They have read it of Aaron's rod, for it is written there. I can't describe it, but if I had the Bible I could read it for you.</answer>

  <answer>I have seen it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>284</questionnumber>

  <answer>Well, I told you it is discribed there. (referring to the bible).</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>285</questionnumber>
  <question>Who else did you ever know that had it?</question>
  <answer>Well Moses had it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>286</questionnumber>
  <question>Moses had it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>287</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, did you know him?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not know him but I have read of him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>288</questionnumber>
  <question>Well who else?</question>
  <answer>There was a great many else had it. It is not for me to say, but I suppose Enoch like enough had it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>289</questionnumber>
  <question>Who else of the Latter Day Saints that you know of had it?</question>
  <answer>Know what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>290</questionnumber>
  <question>Who else in the re-organized church had it?</question>
  <answer>I never said there was any one in the re-organized church had it. I did not say that there was any one in the re-organized church that had it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>291</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am asking you who had it in the re-organized church? That is the question I ask you?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>292</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see any one in the re-organized church of Latter Day Saints that had had it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't know of any one that has had it, but I have seen it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>293</questionnumber>
  <question>You say that you don't know of any one in the re-organized church of Latter Day Saints that has ever had it?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that any one in the re-organized church that has it, but they may have seen it for all I know to the contrary. I don't know everything and they may have it for all I know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>294</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you said in your examination in chief that Joseph was ordained?</question>
  <answer>He was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>295</questionnumber>
  <question>With the horn and oil?</question>
  <answer>He was annointed with oil, and ordained by direct commandment from Heaven. 295 (Second number 295)</answer>

  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I can tell you how that was done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>299</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, please state how that was done?</question>
  <answer>Well he was called up, and he was annointed with oil by Hiram, his uncle, the Patriarch of the church, poured the oil upon his head, and Newel K. Whitney, the bishop, he held the horn, and Joseph laid his hands on him and blessed him, and owned him to be his sucessor in office. Now that is the way it was done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>300</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now then in accordance with what law of the church was that done, - if it was done by any law of the church?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "Well that is objected to for the reason that it is incompetent and immeterial, and not cross examination, and calling for an opinion of the witness". By Mr Southern, -</mono>

  <question>So I understand you to say that this call, and revelation and ordination of Joseph Smith was in accordance with and a direct command from God?</question>

  <question>And that is as true as anything else you have stated here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for that is as true as it can be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>306</questionnumber>
  <question>You say it is true?</question>

  <questionnumber>307</questionnumber>
  <question>And you know it to be true?</question>
  <answer>I do.</answer>

  <question>Well I would like you to state how you know it is true?</question>
  <answer>By his being ordained and annointed, etc. - if it was not true he would not have been ordained or annointed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>309</questionnumber>
  <question>And you testify that as a matter of fact, that was done by a revelation from God?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I told you a little while ago that the Lord gave his Spirit to his servants, and we have a right to reveive it when it is made known to us. He has said "shall I had the things I am about to do from my servants the prophets", etc. He made known his will to Abraham, and has made known his will to Abraham, and has made known his will in many times and ages both before and since, and we are justified in expecting, and have as much right to expect that He will make known his power and Glory in these Latter days to HIs Church, as under any other dispensation. If we cannot look for and reveive that much of his mercy, I will tell you sir we are in a desperate condition, - but I tell you sir, we can get it for God had renewed his convenant with his people, and his gospel has the power of life unto life, or death unto death. His Son our Saviour in these latter days has the power, and the Father will sustain it, for is he not His beloved Son in whom we are to believe, unto our salvation, and the salvation of whomsoever shall believe and partake of the gift he brings us. I will not tell you a thing but what I know is true whether you believe it or do not believe it, - that does not make any difference to me sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>310</questionnumber>
  <question>Your friends will bear me out that I have respected your age, and I have taken no undue advantage of you?</question>
  <answer>You must not think sir that I have anything against you, for you are doing your duty I suppose. I have nothing against you sir at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>311</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you were at Alton at the time of the death or murder of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>312</questionnumber>
  <question>Where was he killed?</question>
  <answer>He was shot down at Carthage jail, and when he fell through the window out in the yard, there was a man that drew his knife and cut his head off, and that man was smote down with a pillar of fire from Heaven.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>313</questionnumber>
  <question>You know that to be a fact do you?</question>
  <answer>Well I was not there at the time, and there is no doubt but it is true.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>314</questionnumber>
  <question>At the time he was killed he left some effects, - some property did he not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>315</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it?</question>
  <answer>He left his household goods and other property.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>316</questionnumber>
  <question>And also he left the Urim and Thummum?</question>
  <answer>Ah, my dear sir the Uim and Thummum was saved. They don't let such things get out. There is no sue in your asking me that, - for that is safe enough, and you could not be made to understand any way, the unbelief that is in you would prevent your understanding.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>317</questionnumber>
  <question>Well he left that did he not?</question>
  <answer>Of course he did not take it with him.</answer>

  <question>Now do you know what became of that?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't know where it is.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason that the same is improper cross-examination, irrelevant, immeterial and incompetent, and not the best evidence"</mono>
  <answer>There is an Urim and Thumnum, but there are different kinds that the Lord has, and as he only had them to interpret he did give them up, - he gave them up and the very plates that were translated he gave up again to the very angel that he took them from, and that angel has hid them, but they will come again in the Lords time, of that you can depend sir.</answer>

    </pagenumber>house, and the church shall not hold another General Conference until they can meet in said house, for thus saith the Lord"? Did you ever hear the elder Joseph Smith annouce that doctrine?
  </question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not the best evidence and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I have heard of it, but I did not hear it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>545</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you have heard of it but you never heard it?</question>
  <answer>I have heard of it. This occured in America before I came here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>546</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever witness any baptisms for the dead before you, - I mean to say, did you ever witness any baptisms for the dead after you came to Nauvoo?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question for the same reasons and on the same grounds as the last preceeding question is objected to.</mono>
  <answer>I was not there until 1842.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>547</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I said, after you came to Nauvoo did you ever witness any baptisms for the dead?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I did one, and I will tell you why if you want to know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>548</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I want to know?</question>
  <answer>Well it was because it was for myself. There is no harm in telling that. I will tell you how it came about. Now the Lord did not say absolutely that there should be no more baptisms for the dead, for he could give his permission to his servant by revelation to do ordinance of baptism for the dead. He could give permission for any one to be baptized if it was His will, and when I went there to Nauvoo I was very much troubled because of that, and why, - because I wanted to be baptized for my father.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>549</questionnumber>
  <question>You were very much troubled because of what?</question>
  <answer>Because of the fact that baptism for the dead had been stopped, and there could be no more baptized without a direct commission or revelation from Heaven. I was talking to one of the High Council about this, and told him how sorry I was, and he said, well he would "speak to Joseph about it, he can ask the Lord about it, and the Lord may give you the ptivClege, but you can't be baptized without it", and I will speak to Joseph about it myself", and he did, and Joseph did enquire, and the Lord did give him the privelege to be baptized for my father, and that is the only baptism for the dead that I ever saw, Now there are the facts, and you can make out of it what you have a mind to, but that is the truth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>550</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the way that came about?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and you can make out of it just what you like.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>551</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you been in the temple at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Well yes sir, I have been in it many a time, for I use to measure all the stone for them, and the carpenter work and all that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>552</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there a font in the temple for the baptism of the dead?</question>
  <answer>Yes and it stood on twelve oxen cut out of stone.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>553</questionnumber>
  <question>And you never saw that font used?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't think it was ever used, because Joseph was killed and the temple was never finished.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>554</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there ever a General conference of the church held at Nauvoo while you were there?</question>

  <answer>Where did they hold them, - where did they hold the conferences?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>558</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>They would generally hold them in the grove, for there was no building that was large enough to hold them in, and the temple was not finished.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>559</questionnumber>
  <question>In holding these conferences was it not in conflict with this doctrine or revelation that conferences were not to be held?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>

  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>Well that would be hard to say. It wasn't the church it had been in Joseph's day.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>641</questionnumber>
  <question>The question is whether you know whether that was the original church, or whether it was an apostate church, or the kind of a church it was?</question>
  <answer>Well I think it was an apostate church for they did not carry out the true principles that were taught by Joseph the Martyr, and there was all manner of abomination committed among them there, and I should consider it was an apostate church, for they taught these abominations and practiced them openly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>642</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that the reason you retired from the church?</question>
  <answer>It was. It was sir, because I could not stand that wickedness, and it was something Joseph never taught and was not taught in in the church in his day.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>643</questionnumber>
  <question>Were those people at Omaha teaching and practicing a doctrine and practices similiar to the doctrine that had been taught and practiced at Nauvoo prior to 1844?</question>
  <answer>Well I will tell you I don't know what they taught, but I will tell you that all the time I was at Nauvoo I never heard it discoursed, - I think they were given up to something else besides preaching there at Omaha from what I saw and heard while I was there.</answer>

  <question>Now did you withdraw from the faith of the church as it was before 1844, or simply from the membership of the church as you saw it Omaha when you were there in 1847?</question>
  <answer>I withdrew from the church, - that church there, - on account of its wickedness. It was because they had become so corrupt and wicked that I could not tolerate it, so I withdrew, but the original faith I believed in it always, all the time through everything from the day I was baptized, and do yet. Now shall I tell you fully what I left them for?</answer>

  <questionnumber>656</questionnumber>
  <question>Who, if you know, was the person who had the charge and custody of that part of the church records?</question>
  <answer>I think James Sloane was the man that had that. He had something to do with the records, and that was what he had I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>657</questionnumber>
  <question>So the records you refer to as being the records you had charge of, were the records of Joseph Smith's private office?</question>

  <answer>Is that what you want, - just what Brigham Young said to me?</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, -</mono>

  <question>Yes sir just go right ahead and tell all he said to you?</question>
  <answer>Well Brigham Young said to me, - "I am not the leader of the church, nor the prophet of the church. We know who that is, it is Joseph the son of Joseph the martyr". I said "yes brother Brigham, that is the one," and he said "it is".</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "The defendants move to strike out the answer of the witness as the most flagrant of hearsay testimony, and irrelevant to any issue in this case". By Mr Kelley, -</mono>

  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "That is objected to as leading".</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>673</questionnumber>
  <question>
    I guess the question is leading, and I will withdraw it. Now what do you mean by the term "ordination", do you mean ordination to the high priesthood, or an ordination simply of successorship?

  <question>What can you say with reference to the enclosure of the property lying within the blue lines?</question>
  <answer>As to whether it was enclosed?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>11</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>18</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know anything about that addition?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I have a recollection of the time that was laid off.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>19</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that on the south of the addition ever enclosed?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is immaterial.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>20</questionnumber>
  <question>That was north, and this was Woodson's pasture, and Woodson lived over there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>21</questionnumber>
  <question>Was Woodson's pasture within these blue lines as indicated here on this plat?</question>
  <answer>There was a fence here between his house and the pasture, and there was a house in here. It might take all that up there, but I don't know about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>22</questionnumber>
  <question>And where was that with reference to Walnut street, did Walnut street adjoin it on the inside?</question>

  <answer>On the east there was a kind of a fence separated it from his lot.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>27</questionnumber>

  <answer>Yes sir. I think this street extended right along here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>28</questionnumber>
  <question>Well on the south side did it?</question>
  <answer>Well it is my recollection on that there was a rail fence down along through here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>29</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it is not a fact that before they opened Walnut street that fence extended through to the Westport road?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is leading and immaterial.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir, but I don't remember distinctly that that was extended through there. I think it was, but I am not positive.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>30</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you know of any one who exercised any acts of ownership over any of this property here in Woodson's and Maxwell's addition which is designated on this map here by the pink or blue as you would call it, part of this plat. Do you know of any acts of ownership that was exercised by any one over this part of the plat, and acts of ownership that was exercised by any one over any part of Woodson and Maxwell's addition prior to the war?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and leading.</mono>
  <answer>Well, my recollection is that there was a little house or two in there. Nor that in my recolleciton and I am pretty postitive that there was a little house or two in there. That was all open ground through here I think. In fact I know this was open vacant ground through here, for I had a run away with a horse one day, and her run in there, and I checked him on this piece of ground and I remember that it was vacant and open ground at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>Now on what place or about what place would you place that house of which you were speaking?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say, but it was in there some place,-it is my recollection that there was more than one house down there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>32</questionnumber>
  <question>At what time was that?</question>
  <answer>Well that was before the war.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>

    </pagenumber>about four or five or six years before the war.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you speaking of a time prior to or subsequent to the time of the laying off of Woodson's and Maxwell's addition?</question>
  <answer>It was laid off after the time I am speaking of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>35</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you sure of that?</question>
  <answer>Well that is my recollection. I could not say as to the years.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>36</questionnumber>
  <question>The time you are speaking of extends back to about 1855, or does it extend back of that?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say, you know, for I can't remember, but I would say that it at lest extends back to that. I was on that place there with Woodson when I was a boy, for we were the same age about, and I used to pass by there when I would be going out to Rock Creek with the boys swimming. We would pass by there on that road, and it was probably along from 1852 on up. We used to go out on that road to Rock Creek to swim, and I think it was from 1852 on up.</answer>

  <questionnumber>45</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever hear him say any thing about how he happened to call one of the streets there adjoining it, Temple street?</question>

  <questionnumber>48</questionnumber>

  <answer>Yes sir, I think so, but I understood that originally there was a good deal more than that of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>49</questionnumber>
  <question>It is the vacant ground that lies within the blue lines and outside of the part that is enclosed, - ?</question>
  <answer>I expect so. I know the highest ground there is called the temple lot, but it is enclosed now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>50</questionnumber>
  <question>Did any body ever ask you to point it out to them?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't know that any body ever asked me to point it out to them, but I have probably done so while driving along through the streets when I would come to it and had a stranger with me I would probably point it out as the temple lot.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>51</questionnumber>
  <question>Every body in the neighborhood knew it was the temple property, did they not?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say that every body in the neighborhood knew it, but it was generally known as that?</answer>

  <questionnumber>54</questionnumber>
  <question>And still they continued, that is the people continued to call it the temple lot even after that addition was laid off there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Some people might not have done so, but I think that that high ground has been called the temple lot by almost everybody here, for that is the place where the Mormon people expected the temple and the gathering to be.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>55</questionnumber>
  <question>Who did?</question>
  <answer>Well it was just by common consent amongst the people talking that they called it the temple lot.</answer>

  <question>How does the title of the property of the local branches of the church in Canada, vest in you as the Bishop of the church?</question>
  <answer>It is held there in part by local trustees, and my instructions has been to the officers there in deeding property to have it deeded directly to the church in its corporate name.

  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>Is the property of the local congregation here, which is said in your bill to have seven hundred members, - seven-hundred or more communicants I believe, but I don't know that that is the exact phraseology that you use, - Is the church property here in your name?</question>

  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>The church building etc?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>I would not say for certain. I know it is not in my name, but it may be in the name of the former Bishop of the church, for it was deeded at the time that E.A. Blakeslee of Galien, Michigan was the Bishop of the church, and it is possible that it is in his name but I think it is in the name of the corporation, - the Re-organized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Now that is my best recollection of it but if you wish to know definately you can assertain the fact by examining the records.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Is the title of the four-hunderd, - of all the four hundred branches in the United States in the name of who is or who was the

    </pagenumber>bishop of the church, - who is the bishop of the church at the present time I will say?
  </question>
  <answer>Well the titles to as number of the local churches run to Israel L. Rogers, as the trustee a and bishop, when he was the bishop of the church. That was for some of them before the society was ever incorporated, and after the appointment of Bishop Blakeslee, some some of the deeds run to him as bishop and trustee, and some were directed to the church in its corporate name, and so it has been since my appointment.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>35</questionnumber>
  <question>And some in other ways?</question>
  <answer>There is none legally held in any other way at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>36</questionnumber>
  <question>There is not?</question>
  <answer>Not that I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>37</questionnumber>
  <question>Now when you held the title of the property of any of these branches, - there is four-hundred of them you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, some thing like that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>38</questionnumber>
  <question>For whose benefit do you hold it?</question>
  <answer>Say what way -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>39</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you hold it for the benefit of that particular branch, or for the benefit of the whole church?</question>
  <answer>There is special regulations of the church with reference to that. It is held for the use and benefit of the society, so long as the society holds together, I mean by that the local society, and so long as it is in harmony with the laws of the church, and acts in harmony with the church as a whole. If it should happen that the local society for any reason or from any cause, should depart from the church, or should become dis-organized from any cause or reason, the general society would not lose its interest in the property. All this property is brought to gether, and obtained by the use of the money of the church and there is where the interest of the general church comes in.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>40</questionnumber>
  <question>Does the general church have any interest in the property of a local branch, except for the benefit of that local branch?</question>
  <answer>Oh yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>41</questionnumber>
  <question>In what manner?</question>
  <answer>Often the local church, I mean to say that often the general church aids these societies in building, - loans them money or aids them in various ways.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>42</questionnumber>
  <question>When the general church loans them money does it loan them the money in trust to be repaid by the local branch to which it is loaned?</question>
  <answer>Well it is owing in a great measure to the circumstances surrounding the case.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>43</questionnumber>
  <question>It is owing to the circumstances surroundings as to whether or not that money shall be repaid?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>44</questionnumber>
  <question>Well does the power given to the trustee that holds the title to the property used by any branch, aurhoize him to sell or convert that property contrary to the wishes of the branch?</question>
  <answer>He might sell it so far as that is concerned, if he did so without authority from the general church and contrary to the wishes of the branch, he would be liable to forfeit his office for so doing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>45</questionnumber>
  <question>Can he dispose of the property of a branch at all, without the consent of that branch?</question>
  <answer>I think it is possible he might.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>46</questionnumber>
  <question>Possible he might?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. There never been such a thing done I will say, and I do not think it is at all likely that it will ever be done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>47</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any law authorizing him to dispose of the property of a branch the title of which is held by him in trust for the use and benefit of that branch?</question>
  <answer>It is held in trust for the use and benefit of the general church</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>48</questionnumber>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>49</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any law of the church particularly or generally giving him such power as that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, there is simply what you find in the articles of incorporation already introduced in evidence in this case.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>50</questionnumber>
  <question>Only the powers you say that are found in the articles of incorporation already introduced in evidence in this case?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>51</questionnumber>
  <question>Can the authority of that incorporation, the articles which have been introduced in this case, be invoked to transfer the property of a local branch without the consent of that branch?</question>
  <answer>That has never been done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>52</questionnumber>
  <question>What is that you say?</question>
  <answer>It never has been done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>53</questionnumber>
  <question>Can it be done?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that is calls for a legal opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>I think it would be doubtful.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>54</questionnumber>
  <question>You think it would be doubtful as to whether it could be done or not?</question>
  <answer>It might be done, but whether it would be, well possibly in some of the states it would be declared legal under the law, but whether it would be helf to be legal and just by the society is another question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>55</questionnumber>
  <question>Is the corporation of which you speak, authorized to hold any property other than that which holds for the use and benefit of the various branches of which it is as a whole composed?</question>
  <answer>The articles of incorporation show just what property it is authorized to hold. Now you are asking as for conclusions based upon facts and I do not think it is proper for me to state any conclusions. I state the facts and you can draw your own conclusions, and this last conclusion of mine that it is proper for me to state only the fact I think you will find upon the trial, that it is a conclusion in which the court will sustain me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>56</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that may be. Now I will ask you if the general conference of the church as such, hold any property in cotra-distinction to the property of the local branches?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Speaking of the general conference of the church generally it does.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>57</questionnumber>
  <question>As the church generally it does?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That is in the sense of holding property other than the church buildings. If I understand your question that is what you refer to?</answer>

  <answer>I notice there is some words that are partially obliterated here apparently by the fastening to the opposite page. "Apostle Lorenzo Snow's testimony. The following affidavit was made before J.C. Wright, Clerk of Box Elder County, Utah, August 28th 1869. It is as follows, - "In the month of April 1843, I returned from my European mission. A few days after after my arrival at Nauvoo, when at President Joseph Smith's house, he said he wished to have some private talk with me and requested me to walk out with him. It was towards evening, and we walked a little distance and sat down on a large log that lay near the bank of the river. He there and then explained to me the doctrine of plurality of wives. He said that the Lord had revealed him as wives, - that he foresaw the trouble that would follow and sought to turn away from the commandment, that an angel from heaven appeared before him with a drawn sword, threatening him with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment. He further said that my sister Eliza R. now had been sealed to him as his wife for time and eternity. He told me that the Lord would open the way, and I should have women sealed to me as wives, in which he told me many important things. I solemnly declare before God and the holy angels, and as I hope to come forth in the morning of the resurrection, that the above statement is true. Signed, Lorenzo Snow."</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. P. P. Kelley, - "We move the court to exclude what the witness has just read from the record for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, for the further reason that the book, pamphlet or publication from which the witness read, or the document from which he read has not been identified or placed in evidence, and for the further reason we object to it on the ground that under the statutes of the United States it is inadmissible, being a declaration between a party living and a party dead, and for the further reason that there is no issue in the state, [when which the same can be {implicated?} as testimony in this case], and it is also in violation of the statutes of the state of Missouri under which this case will be tried the same prohibiting declarations between a party living and a party dead."

  <question>Mr. Snow state what offices in the church you held and when you held them?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons as set forth in the last objection to the question to which objection was made.</mono>
  <answer>The first office I held was in Kirtland, - I think in the thirties, - it might have been in the latter part of '36, - if not it was in the fore part of thirty I received the office of seventy, and directly afterwards, within a few days, two or three days, I was ordained to the office of high priest. That was in Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois, and it was in the year '39. It was in the fall of 1849 just about as I was leaving for my European mission.</answer>

  <questionnumber>45</questionnumber>
  <question>You were sent out to represent the doctrines of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Well yes sir, I may say I was, but there is some qualification to that, for I was sent out to preach the first principles of the church. We were generally confined to first principles when we went on missions.</answer>

  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he use the word "time" as well as "eternity"?</question>
  <answer>I think so, but I couldn't say positively. That was distinctly understood you know. I believe, I would say that I solemnly believe so to the best of my knowledge, because that is a term that is generally used in the matter when the question of plural marriage is spoken of in reference to sealing "for time and eternity". That is the way it is generally referred to you know, in speaking of the matter of plural marriage.</answer>

  <question>Did you ever hear of a man's wife being sealed to him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>97</questionnumber>
  <question>You have heard of that?</question>
  <answer>Certainly I have heard of women being sealed to men, but of men being sealed to one another, I never heard of that until now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>98</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it not common to seal a man's wife to him, - that is was not the principle common after Joseph's death and was it not practiced in the church at that time?</question>
  <answer>Certainly. Now do I understand you to ask me the question about a man being sealed to a man?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>99</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>In what way?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>100</questionnumber>
  <question>Sealed to one higher in authority, so the whole family would be his in eternity?</question>
  <answer>You ask me if I now know or ever did know anything about a man being sealed to a man, and I say no, I never knew or heard of such a thing as that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>101</questionnumber>
  <question>This is the first time that you have learned that in the church there was such a principle as plural marriage, to be acceptable or to be accepted?</question>
  <answer>Well as you ask that question I say no. It is not the first time I have heard of the principle. I have heard of these principles before, but not exactly as you put your question.</answer>

  <question>
    When was the first time? Well about three days be-

    </pagenumber>fore that time. There was a man by the name of Sherwood, an intimate friend of mine, and he was a great friend to Joseph Smith, an intimate friend to him in Kirtland, and there I became acquainted with his man Sherwood, and he came here to Salt Lake City, and became the President of the high priest's quorum.
  </question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>103</questionnumber>
  <question>Well never mind that?</question>
  <answer>Well I want to tell you something about the man for he had something to do with this matter, and for that reason I want to tell you something about him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>104</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I don't want to hear it, for whatever he told you would be hearsay?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, I am getting old and you must let me be a little like a woman and give me a little latitude, and if you do that I will come out all right and tell you these things so you can understand them distinctly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>105</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then go ahead, that is all right.</question>
  <answer>Well I had only returned to Nauvoo a few days, two or three, maybe four or five days, and I called on this gentleman Mr. Sherwood, and had quite a chat with him, and he asked me to step out to one side, and he said this.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the answer of the witness on the ground that it is hearsay and incompetent.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>106</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I know it is, but the witness desires to tell his story in this own way. We object to it as hearsay but it seems he will tell it that way anyway.</question>
  <answer>Well this man Sherwood said to me "Lorenzo", calling me by my name, he called me by my given name, and he said "Lorenzo I want to tell you something to prepare your mind". He said, "I have no right to tell you this but I will do it to prepare your mind" and then he went on and explained these principles to me.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness and moves the court to exclude the same from the record on the ground that it is irrelevant and immaterial and hearsay, and not responsive to any question asked the witness on cross examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>Then Joseph Smith was not the first person that explained those principles to you. That is the fact is it not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, he was not, not if you consider the other man as being an authority at all equal to Joseph Smith.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness for the reasons about given, and moves the court to exclude the answer from the record for the same reason.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>108</questionnumber>
  <question>What time did you live in Kirtland, Ohio?</question>
  <answer>I was there in 1836.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>109</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you there at the time of the convening of the General Assembly?</question>
  <answer>No sir. It was a few months before. I was there in the spring and what you allude to by that meeting was probably in April. However I was not there at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>110</questionnumber>
  <question>Look at that book and state if you ever saw it before?</question>
  <answer>I can't say that I ever saw that one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>111</questionnumber>
  <question>Or one like it, state the face in that connection?</question>
  <answer>It was printed in 1835 I see, but I can't say whether I ever saw it before of not. I suppose however that I saw one similar to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>112</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that not an authorized work of the church at that time, when you belonged to it?</question>
  <answer>Well I would think so, but I would not swear to it. I would swear that I think it was from the fact that I see the witness here to their names published by F.J. Williams & Company at Kirtland, Ohio in 1835. I would imagine that that was recognized as a book published by the church.</answer>

  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is the paragraph with reference to marriage?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>114</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, here it is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>115</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that not the law and doctrine of the church upon the question of marriage?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. It was at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>116</questionnumber>
  <question>It was at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>117</questionnumber>
  <question>You stated a while ago that you didn't know of any law?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>118</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I said it was probably in the book of Doctrine and Covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>119</questionnumber>
  <question>I understood you to say when you were examined, that you did not think the church had ever spoken upon the question of marriage?</question>
  <answer>Well I thought you had reference to the ceremony that was used, when two persons came together to get married, and I did not remember the ceremony, and I don't think that embraces the ceremony at all. What is it anyway?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>120</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you ought to be acquainted with it. I think, - you were on a mission and you certainly ought to be acquainted with that?</question>
  <answer>Well I will ask you what it says, - you have looked it over.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>121</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you are the witness. Was there any special ceremony at that time?</question>
  <answer>At what time?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>122</questionnumber>
  <question>At the time you were with the church you speak of?</question>
  <answer>There might have been, but yet I don't think they were particularly confined to any particular words. If that is what you refer to I would like you to read it so that it might bring it back to my memory. I am getting old and I don't remember matters as well as I would like to.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>123</questionnumber>
  <question>I refer to the doctrine that a man could have more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>No sir, no sir, - I told you all the time that I didn't remember the words.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>124</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will ask you the question that I did before when you were out in 1839 were you instructed with reference to the law of marriage to teach plurality of wives, or monogamy?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I received no instructions to teach plural marriage.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>125</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not receive any instructions to teach a plurality of wives?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>126</questionnumber>
  <question>Was not monogamy the law of the church at the time.</question>
  <answer>I was a bachelor and I never expected to be married at that time, and I never once heard of it until I heard of this plural marriage business. I will answer your questions directly and to the point, if you will make me acquainted with them, - or ask them so that I can understand you meaning clearly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>127</questionnumber>
  <question>At that time you were acquainted with the revelations of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Not all of them.</answer>

  <question>Are you now acquainted with the revelations of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Not all of them.</answer>

  <question>You were sent out to preach the doctrine of the church?</question>
  <answer>Partially, - I was sent out to preach first principles.</answer>

  <question>Who represented them in Great Britain?</question>
  <answer>
    I represented all that the circumstances required in the situation I was placed in at various times, and I represented the doctrine of the church so far as the first principles were concerned, - such as faith, baptism and the laying on of hands and where it required any special doctrine that was re-

  <answer>I said I did not understand there was any special ceremony.</answer>

  <question>You say now you said you did not understand there was any such a ceremony?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>135</questionnumber>
  <question>Now sir, I will get you to read the second paragraph of section one hundred and one, on marriage, in the 1835 edition of the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not pertinent to any of the issues involved in this case.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>136</questionnumber>
  <question>You may read it out aloud so that it may be incorporated in your testimony?</question>
  <answer>Do you want the entire section?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>137</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, the entire section, - you may read it all if you so desire. We only care particularly for the second paragraph, but you may read he whole thing if you choose to do so, if it will assist you any?</question>
  <answer>
    Well I'll read it all, - Section 101, Marriage. 1st paragraph, - According to the custom of all civilized nations, marriage is regulated by rules and ceremonies, therefore we believe that all marriages in this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, should be solemnized in a public meeting or feat prepared for that purpose: and that the solemnization should be performed by a presiding high priest, high priest, bishop, elder or priest not even prohibiting those persons who are desirous to get married of being married by other authority. We believe it is not right to prohibit members of this church from marrying out of the church, if it be their determination so to do, but such persons will be considered weak in the faith of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. 2nd, - Marriage should be celebrated with prayer and thanks giving, and at the solemnization the persons to be married standing together, the man on the right and the woman on the left, shall be addressed by the person officiating as he shall be directed by the Holy Spirit, and if there be no legal objections, he shall say, calling each by their names: "You both mutually agree to be each other's companions, husband and wife, observing the legal rights belonging to this condition: that is, keeping yourselves wholly for each other and from all others during your lives"? Aan when they have answered "yes" he shall pronounce them "husband and wife" in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the laws of he country and authority vested in him; "may God add his blessings and keep you to fulfill your covenants from henceforth, and forever. Amen." 3rd, - The clerk of every branch should keep a record of all marriages solemnized in his branch. 4th, - All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is received into this church should be held sacred and fulfilled. Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have but one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again. It is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will of her husband, neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband. All to influence them to embrace any religious faith, or be baptized, or leave their parents without their consent is unlawful

    </pagenumber>and unjust. We believe that all persons who exercise control over their fellow beings, and prevent them from embracing the truth, will have to answer for that sin.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>138</questionnumber>
  <question>Now how do you harmonize your statement that the church had not spoken on it, - that is on the question of marriage, - after reading that section?</question>
  <answer>I told you that there might have been something spoken on it, but I didn't remember particularly what it was. I do not remember as to the precise words that were used when the woman stood up with the man to be married. I did not know there was any particularly necessity of strictly conforming to anything of that kind.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>139</questionnumber>
  <question>You were an elder of the church at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I told you I was an elder of the church at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>140</questionnumber>
  <question>They were authorized to perform the marriage ceremony?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I knew that, but I told you that I never married any one because I was a bachelor, and I did not believe in it so far as I was concerned. I suppose if I had been in the habit of marrying I would have remembered about it, although I can't say that I would remember that it was absolutely necessary to adhere to any strict formula in performing the ceremony of marriage. I do not know that I would remember that it was abosolutely necessary to confine yourself abosolutely to any particular words in doing that, if the substance would be employed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>141</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to look at the revelation in section thirteen and read paragraph seven, Mr. Snow?</question>
  <answer>And again I say unto you, thou shalt not kill, but he that killeth shall die. Thou shalt not steal, and he that stealeth, and will not repent, shall be case out. Thou shalt not lie; and he that lieth and will not repent shall be case out. Thou shalt love they wife with all thy heart, and shall cleave unto her and none else; and he that looketh on a woman to lust after her, shall deny the faith, and shall not have the spirit, and if he repents not he shall be cast out. Thou shalt not commit adultery; but he that has committed adultery and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh, it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive; but if he do it again he shall not be foregiven, but shall be cast out. Thou shalt not speak evil of they neighbor, nor do him any harm. Thou knowest my laws concerning these things are given in my scriptures; he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out."</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness and the paragraph just read by the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompent, irrelevant and immaterial, and improper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I am willing the gentleman shall ask me any question he pleases, - I make no objection to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>142</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recognize that as a doctrine of the church at the time you belonged to it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it always has been and is today the doctrine of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>143</questionnumber>
  <question>You recognize that as the doctrine of the church?</question>
  <answer>I do sir, entirely and fully.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>144</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that the doctrine that was taught by Brigham Young here in the Valley, and the church here after his time, upon the marriage question?</question>
  <answer>I don't know whether it is or not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>145</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know whether it is or not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, - just let me look at it again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>146</questionnumber>
  <question>Well this is the point, - "Thou shalt love they wife with all they heart and shall cleave unto her and none else"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is right.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>147</questionnumber>
  <question>That doctrine was taught?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>148</questionnumber>
  <question>It was taught here in the Valley by Brigham Young and the ones that succeeded him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I believe it fully and entirely. I endorse that absolutely.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>149</questionnumber>
  <question>And Brigham Young taught that too?</question>
  <answer>I believe he did, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>150</questionnumber>
  <question>And the purported revelation taught it also?</question>
  <answer>Let me see. Read it again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>151</questionnumber>
  <question>Thou shalt love they wife with all they heart, and shall cleave unto her and none else, and he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, etc.?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>152</questionnumber>
  <question>And the purported revelation of 1848 is the same as that, - the polygamy revelation?</question>
  <answer>I think when a man has a dozen wives he can cleave to them all and love them all. 153 (Written as 133)</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>153</questionnumber>
  <question>You have not answered my question Mr. Snow, - I asked you if the revelation of 1843 taught the same as that I have just read?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is irrelevant and immaterial and improper cross examination, - the revelation itself being the best evidence, and the question as framed calls for an opinion of the witness, and defendant moves the court to strike out any answer of the witness that may be given to the question for that reason.</mono>
  <answer>I apprehend there is no disagreement between the revelation of 1843 or 1844, - I mean the revelation of 1843, - I apprehend sir, that there is no disagreement or difference between them when they are explained in connection. I believe sir, that they are in harmony.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>154</questionnumber>
  <question>I will renew my question, - does the revelation of 1843 that was accepted by the church to which you now belong, in 1852, contain the same teaching on the question of marriage as is contained in these sections you have read?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, I will answer that question right directly by saying that I think it does. 155 (Written as 153)</answer>
  <question>I will read paragraph three from section sixty five in this connection, and it is in this same edition of the book of doctrine and covenants, being the 1835 edition? "And again I say unto you that whoso forbiddeth to marry, is not ordained of god, for marriage is ordained of God unto man; wherefore it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation, and that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made. And whoso forbiddeth to abstain from meats, that man should not eat the same, is not ordained of God; for behold the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which cometh of the earth is ordained for the use of man, for good and for raiment, and that he might have in abundance, but it is not given that one man should possess that which is above another; wherefore the world lieth in sin; and woe be unto man that sheddeth blood or wasteth flesh, and hath no need"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>156</questionnumber>
  <question>You recognize that as the teaching of the original church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I recognize that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>157</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that the same as the teaching of the purported revelation of 1848?</question>
  <answer>One is more extensive than the other, but they don't disagree.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>158</questionnumber>
  <question>Which is the more extensive of the two?</question>
  <answer>The last one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>159</questionnumber>
  <question>Which one is that?</question>
  <answer>The one which allows a man to have a dozen wives if he sees fit.</answer>

  <question>For how long?</question>
  <answer>Well I was there off and on, and was traveling from one place to another. I was traveling a good deal of the time from one place to another, but off and on I was there a part of the time. I was there most of the time I might say from 1843 until we moved to the Valley.</answer>

  <questionnumber>182</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it was not presented to the church according to your knowledge?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not to my knowledge. It might have been presented to the church and I not know it, for I was away so much of the time, but I hardly think it was done for the reason that I would have heard of it, but I have no recollection of hearing anything of the kind at all.</answer>

    </pagenumber>order of marriage in the church?
  </question>
  <answer>Well it is a fact that the order of marriage was changed, but whether that was the purpose of the substitution or not I do not know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>204</questionnumber>
  <question>The order of marriage was changed, and the old order was eliminated, - is that not the fact?</question>
  <answer>Well it was changed or extended, as I told you before. It was changed from the one to the other.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>205</questionnumber>
  <question>It was changed from monogamy to polygamy was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. You might say it was if it suits you. It was extended from monogamy to polygahy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>206</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I believe you state, -?</question>
  <answer>Well I want to explain, - I am willing to answer your questions, and I will answer them as well as I can, but I claim the privilege of answering them in my own language and in my own may as best I can, - that is my right and I claim it. I must have a little leeway, for my memory is not of the best at the present time, - it is not as good as it used to be some years ago. I am much older now than you imagine by looking at me, and in a few weeks, if I live, I will see seventy eight, and you will find if you live until seventy eoght that you will not have an extraordinary memory.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>207</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you are growing very old Mr. Snow, but then we had an apostle on the stand that was eighty a few days ago, - a few weeks ago I should say?</question>
  <answer>Well now this matter of plural marriage is not extended to everybody and was not. Everybody did not understand it at all. It is limited in its scope, and it is not everybody that was prepared to receive this doctrine. Everybody is not prepared to receive it, and the doctrine was made known to certain parties under certain conditions, so it was very limited in its scope.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>208</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it was the introduction of another system besides the original one?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. You might call it such, for it was the extension from the principle of one wife to more than one wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>209</questionnumber>
  <question>Now than under your law, and under this revelation, would it prevent every man in the church from having more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>Would what? I don't understand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>210</questionnumber>
  <question>Would this polygamous revelation here, - would it prevent any man in the church from having more than one wife if he wanted to?</question>

  <question>Please answer the question?</question>

  <questionnumber>213</questionnumber>
  <question>Under the operation of this law of plural marriage or this revelation, every man that wanted to do so, could have more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for I think there was lots of them that oughtn't to have one wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>214</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when you were a bachelor, one wife didn't extend or include you, because you did not want it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and you would not want it too, if you did not want her. 215 (This question and answer are missing)</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>216</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the way you understand this polygamous revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, something in that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>217</questionnumber>
  <question>That is you state that if a person should be married or sealed by this revelation, according to your understanding, - that is, if they should be married according to the provisions of this polygamous revelation prior to the year 1848, that they would be violating the laws of the church and would be guilty of adultery?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>226</questionnumber>
  <question>And she was sealed to him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is it exactly. Now you have got it, - she was sealed to him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>227</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then according to your understanding of this new covenant the woman is sealed to the man, and not the man to the woman?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, you are right now, and I am very happy that you have got right for once.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>228</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am glad too that I am right at last, as you put it, so you see our joy is mutual?</question>
  <answer>Well yes sir that is right and I am glad of it, but if you think you can get into any of these things now you are mistaken, for you can't do it. The whole thing has been stopped, and there is no more of it here now, so you can't find out anything about the operation of this principle in this place, for the whole thing has been stopped.</answer>

  <answer>Well it was all the same.</answer>

  <questionnumber>258</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say it was given to him before that time?</question>
  <answer>I say that he explained to me the principles of plural marriage distinctly and clearly, and told me that the Lord had revealed the principle, and had commanded him to enter into that practice, and that he had received a revelation to that effect. He said that he had demurred to doing so as he foresaw the trouble that would ensue, but that an angel of the Lord had appeared before him with a drawn sword commanding him to do so, and he could not go backward. It was in substance that that he told me, but of course I do not pretend to relate the exact language he used.</answer>

  <answer>I was sent to Europe in 1839, and I returned from Europe in 1843 as I told you before. I returned from Europe some time in April 1843, - in the latter part of April 1843 I think it was.

  <question>Then to your knowledge this purported revelation o 1843 was never brought before the church for acceptance during the life-time of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was never brought before the public in a public way by public proclamation or announcement. It was never brought before the public in any other way before the death of Joseph Smith, only as I have state it there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>278</questionnumber>
  <question>Only as stated here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>279</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was the only way?</question>
  <answer>The only way I know anything about. It was taught privately.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>280</questionnumber>

    I asked you Mr. Snow, if it would be binding upon the

      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0011-Pages_92-147-ORIGINAL/36.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 126</a>
    </pagenumber>church until it had been accepted by the church?
  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it would be to those that chose to accept it as binding. The people had the most implicit and perfect confidence in Joseph Smith, and when he gave a revelation, whether it was accepted or not, it didn't make any difference with some, for they had the most perfect confidence in him, so they would accept it and act upon it whether the church as a church had acted upon it by accepting it did not make any difference.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>285</questionnumber>
  <question>Would it be a part of the church laws until it had been accepted by the church?</question>
  <answer>That would depend on the circumstances.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>286</questionnumber>
  <question>That would depend on circumstances, you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>287</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I would like you to explain what you mean by that answer?</question>
  <answer>I mean just what I said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>288</questionnumber>
  <question>Well mention the circumstances, or the circumstance where a revelation would become a part of the church law, without acceptance on the part of the church?</question>
  <answer>Well take myself for example, - Joseph might give a revelation on certain important matters, and I not knowing the revelation, or what he had given it, it would not be binding on me even if it had been accepted as you put it, by the church: but if he gave a revelation and I knew that he gave it, it would be binding on me even before it was accepted by the church, - that is the way I feel about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>289</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now if he should have a revelation and it should not be presented to the church, would it be binding on the church, - that is the question, - not what you consider or feel yourself, - but would it be binding upon the church?</question>
  <answer>Well it would not be binding upon the church, for the church as a church would not know it if it was not presented formally to the church as a church, but it would be binding upon such as knew of it. Now if you will allow me to explain I would like to do so. If that revelation is presented to me, and there is a half a dozen men and women and it is presented to them, it would be a law to them, and be binding upon them, and any other part of the church that had knowledge, - distinct and definite knowledge of it, but I do not think it would be binding upon any other part of the church other than that which had knowledge of its existence. Do you understand that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>290</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I think I do, - clearly too?</question>

  <questionnumber>320</questionnumber>
  <question>Well are you through?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>321</questionnumber>
  <question>Then I wish you would answer my question. Could he receive a revelation and act upon it, that was contrary in its teachings and provisions to the laws of the church to govern the church, with out a violation of those laws?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I see that distinctly and understand it, and I want you to understand it too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>322</questionnumber>
  <question>Well just answer my question,-you can answer it yes or no?</question>
  <answer>What is the question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>323</questionnumber>
  <question>Could Joseph Smith receive a revelation and act upon it that was contrary in its teachings and provisions to the laws of the church as accepted by the church at that time, without being at the same time in violation of the laws of the church?</question>
  <answer>Why he might do so. Joseph Smith and did, but I don't consider he was violator of any of the laws of the church, for he was the law of the church. I never knew of the church rejecting a revelation he gave to them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>324</questionnumber>
  <question>You mean that Joseph Smith might and did receive revelations,-what do you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>I mean that he might receive revelations and act on them, and did so receive them and act on them, and so did Moses and Christ and other prophets. They all received revelations, and call it presumption or what you choose they assumed the authority given them, and acted on them forthwith. They were not presumptuous enough to question the voice of the Lord when it came to them in the form of a commandment, neither was Joseph.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>325</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now you have not answered my question yet,-I asked you if Joseph Smith received a revelation that was a variance with the laws of the church as accepted by the church,-what would you be his position if acted up such a revelation without submitting it to the church?</question>
  <answer>Joseph might have received a revelation that was apparently perhaps,-perhaps it might apparently be in contradiction, and yet it does not come to my mind now what circumstances might arise. Now I see what you are after, and I wish to explain it so you may understand what I mean, and know all about it. Joseph Smith received a revelation in reference to plural marriage, and the church he thought in his wisdom was not properly prepared to receive that revelation,- 327 (Should be 326)</answer>
  <question>He thought the church was not properly prepared to receive that revelation, you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>327</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know he thought that?</question>
  <answer>Well he told me so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>328</questionnumber>
  <question>He told you that the church was not prepared for it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is what he told me. And he told me one particular person that was not prepared for it and that was his brother Hyrum.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the answer of the witness on the ground that it is hearsay.</mono>
  <answer>(continued) And I will tell you the reason why if you wish to it?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>329</questionnumber>
  <question>Well never mind that,-that is not a part of my examination, You have told the fact and that is sufficient. You have stated that Joseph Smith said to you that the church was not prepared for it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations that you have recieved, and shall receive through him whom I have appointed."

  <answer>He was never se apart by Joseph Smith as his successor that I am aware of</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>402</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will ask you why it is that you have revelations here in your book of doctrine and covenants, purporting to be the word of the law the Lord through Brigham Young, when it is stated in the original law of the church that none shall be received except the one through, or by Joseph? Why do you receive these things?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants object to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, and calling for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>Well that was understood that during his time,-that is during Joseph's time of exercising his authority as there were persons who undertook to exercise their authority, or other authority in his time on several occasions. They undertook to take the office from him and exercise the authority pertaining to it. I recollect an instance of the kind that occurred in Kirtland, and that law was made to be operative in his time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>403</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't it apply after his time the same, unless they receive the appointment through him, as designated here?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>I don't know</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>404</questionnumber>
  <question>Does not the language so state?</question>
  <answer>Well there is many things in the revelations of the old testament and the new that seem to conflict unless they are reasoned out, and so it is with that. You will find statements in both the old testament and the new testament, and afterwards you will find that changes are made. Now there is the instance of Moses, where there was a law made or given,-</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>405</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you say there was a change made in this?</question>
  <answer>There was a law given and afterwards circumstances arose that rendered a change necessary, but it was not in Joseph's time. The necessity for the change did not arise until after Joseph's time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>406</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say there was a change made in this?</question>
  <answer>There may have been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>407</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say there was or was not?</question>
  <answer>I think the Lord has a perfect right to make a change any time he sees fit or pleases to do it; and we find always from the days of Adam down to the days of John the revelator there was the most extra ordinary changes made, and so it was in this case, for the Lord mad them in this case.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>408</questionnumber>
  <question>Has he contradicted his word flatly at any tme in any of these changes Mr. Snow?</question>

    </pagenumber>contradiction at all. It is only to men's fallible judgment that there appears to be a contradiction as in reality there is no contradiction. Now you have asked for my opinion, and you have it.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>411</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you mention anything in the bible or book of doctrine and covenants, or the book of Mormon, or in either or any of these books that is in any, - that is in contradiction to any of the laws he has given to the church?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and improper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Well in the days of Noah it says the Lord repented him of certain things, and it says at different time he repented. There was one time it says he made a determination to destroy Israel entirely, and Moses through his exertion and force and power he had with God, seated face to face with God as the only perfected man, - he argued and reasoned with him and told him what the people would say, and he said to him in effect, - "you undertook to deliver Israel, and could not carry out the job, - you failed, and now" said he "don't do this thing".</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>412</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did Moses ever say this?</question>
  <answer>Well I see you are not well acquainted with the bible.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>413</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I would like to know all about that?</question>
  <answer>Do you say there is no such thing as that in the bible?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>414</questionnumber>
  <question>Well ther may be some such tging as that, -?</question>
  <answer>Well Moses prayed with the Lord and through his arguments and prayer and persuasion he changed the mind of the Lord entirely with reference to the destruction of Israel.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>415</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but that is not the question. You see you do not know as much about the bible as you ought to for you wanted me to point to one passage in the bible, - you wanted me to cite an instance, and I am citing instances, - I am showing it from the bible itself, and now you try to evade these points after asking for them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>416</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it don't matter what I am trying to evade, - you please answer the questions I ask you and we will get along much better, for it may be that I know more about the bible than you credit me with knowing. Now you still believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet, and he did the work he claimed to do?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>417</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know that when he translated that passage you quoted from Genesis, that he did it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but when it comes down to the fact I don't know that he did all the work he claimed to do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>418</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know that when he translated that passage that you attempted to quote from Genesis, that he found it was not correct that God repented there?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>419</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I do not. I don't know anything about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>420</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and I never saw it either. I don't know that he ever translated any such a thing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>421</questionnumber>
  <question>So you bring that up as an instance where God changed and repented of a pre-conceived determination, do you?</question>

  <questionnumber>424</questionnumber>
  <question>You quoted from the King James translation, did you not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not quote anything at all, and did not attempt to quote anything at all. I simply stated my understanding of it in my own language. I did not pretend to give the language of the quotation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>425</questionnumber>
  <question>So then you do not know what translation you wee quoting from?</question>
  <answer>Well I suppose sir, I gathered this from Joseph Smith's translation.</answer>

  <question>You do not use that translation of the bible here in the church in this territory, do you?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>430</questionnumber>
  <question>And yet you don't know everything that is done in the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir. You are a lawyer and yet you don't know everything you ought to know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>431</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I admitted that a while ago, - and you certainly ought to know the books that your church uses as authority?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I ought to know. There is many things I ought to know and do not know, like yourself, but I think I might know if I would run it down.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>432</questionnumber>
  <question>Now at the time you first joined the church, what kind of a church was it, - an monogamist church, or a church that believed in plural wives?</question>
  <answer>It did not believe in more than one wife, - just one wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>433</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it was monogamist on that point?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was just one wife in those days.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>434</questionnumber>
  <question>And now you belong to a church that believes in how many wives?</question>
  <answer>Well it depends on circumstances as to how many wives a man might have, - as many as Jacob had, as many as Abraham had, but not as many as Solomon had, - he had three hundred or something like that I believe, and he was a wise man too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>435</questionnumber>
  <question>And yet notwithstanding the fact that the church at the time you joined it permitted a man to have but one wife, and this church permitted a man to have as many as he pleased, you still claim that it is the same church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>436</questionnumber>
  <question>The same church that it was in 1836?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, the same church that it was in 1836, - it has always been the same church.</answer>

  <question>It has the same law in reference to the doctrine of marriage?</question>

  <question>Has it not changed the law with reference to marriage?</question>
  <answer>No sir, - well yes, I suppose it has, - it has extended it.</answer>

  <question>Has it extended it from one wife to a plurality of wives?</question>

  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <question>Have you not just a moment ago stated that when you first joined the church in 1836, it permitted a man to have but one wife, and now you believe - or your church since that time has permitted people to belong to it that have more than one wife?</question>

  <question>In what way would it become a law, and to whom would it be a law?</question>
  <answer>It would become a law to everybody that would or should believe it. Of course it could not become a law to the church as a body before it was formally presented to the church in some of its conferences, but to every person who had notice of it or to whom it was communicated it would be a law from that time. Now there is the revelation that Joseph communicated to me that time on my return to Nauvoo. -that was never, -at any rate not at that time laid before the church, -the church had no notice of it, but it was a law to me and I was bound by it after the time it had been known to me.</answer>

  <question>Mr. Snow in your cross examination you made a statement in regard to the marriage ceremony, or your not knowing anything about it. Now I want you to state to the reporter whether you know that as a fact, or is that simply your best recollection about it?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the questions asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is immaterial.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>463</questionnumber>
  <question>You may answer the question?</question>
  <answer>Well it was according to my best recollection, for as I said I never knew much about this marriage business. I never had much to do, -or anything to do I might say, - with this marriage business at that time, for I was a bachelor until I was thirty three, or thirty or somewhere along there, and at the time the question was asked me it did not occur to my mind that there was any special ceremony. That is in former times, it did not occur to my mind now that there was any special ceremony then. Now I would like to say a word or two further on that point.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>464</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you can do so.</question>
  <answer>These ceremonies were intended to be observed of course or they would not be presented in the form they are, but they are not always observed to the letter. Now in regard to baptism there is sometimes made use of different words from those laid down in the books, but when that is done either in the ordinance of baptism or marriage it is done through ignorance and from not understanding the formula properly, but it is not at all considered that on that account or for that reason, it decreases the value of the ordinance, because the party performing it does not happen to conform exactly to the formula laid down.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>465</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is all.</question>

    </pagenumber>velations before the church for acceptance, Mr. Snow. Did you state that to be the fact?
  </question>
  <answer>Well as a general thing that was not done, - there may be exceptions as I have said, - there certainly are exceptions when they were brought before the body of the church. I know there is something in regard to the matter, but it is not in my mind now. I cannot remember about these things now as I once did, but there was something of that kind done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>467</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know there was a usage of the church to that effect? Don't you know as a matter of fact that there was usage to that effect, now that you come to thank of it, and that the revelations were presented to the general assembly at Kirtland and accepted.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>468</questionnumber>
  <question>You know the revelations contained in the 1835 edition of the book of doctrine and covenants were presented to the church there and accepted?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I know that it was also done at other places, - at least I have heard that it was done. Now as you mention, and so what I know about this is hearsay.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>469</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was that the rule?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>470</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will read to you from the Times and Seasons a statement made by Orson Hyde to the Quorum of Twelve. It is in the Times and Seasons Vol. 3 page 649, published September 8th 1844?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness and the reading of the extract from the Times and Seasons above referred to on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and on the further ground that the book counsel reads from is not identified or produced in evidence as an exhibit in this case.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>471</questionnumber>
  <question>I will read you this and see if you identify it Mr Snow. "There is a way by which all revelations purporting to be from God through any man can be tested. Brother Joseph gave us the plan, says he, when all the quorums are assembled and organized in order, let the revelation be presented to the quorums, if it pass one let it go to another, and if it pass that to another, and so on until it has passed all the quorums; and if it pass the whole without running against a snag, then, says he, you may know it wants inquiring into; you must see to it. It is known to some who are present that there is a quorum organized where revelations can be tested. Brother Joseph said, let no revelation go to the people until it has been tested here." Now I will ask you if you recognize that?</question>
  <answer>That is a very good doctrine. 471 (Mistakenly numbered as a second 471)</answer>
  <question>I ask you if you recognize - that as the rule of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that was the doctrine as I told you before.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>472</questionnumber>
  <question>So that was the rule instead of there being no rule, when you come to think about it?</question>
  <answer>Well that was the rule but as I told you before there was exceptions to the rule, and you can see the reason of it too. Revelations were often given when the whole of the church were not present, and there is some of the quorums that have to confirm the revelations before it can ever go before the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>473</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was the rule of the church at that time, - always was the rule of the church prior to the death of Joseph Smith wasn't it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, with the exception that I speak of, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>474</questionnumber>
  <question>No you were asked this question, - was a revelation binding upon the church as soon as it was made known to the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>That question was asked you, - and you answered it "yes sir."</question>

  <questionnumber>476</questionnumber>
  <question>Now is a revelation binding upon the church, before it is made known to the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>477</questionnumber>
  <question>It is not binding upon the church then until it is made known to the church?</question>
  <answer>Certainly not, but it is binding upon such individuals as to whom it may be made known. If a revelation was made known to an individual it is binding upon him, even if it has not been made known to the church. I have repeated that answer I suppose a dozen times.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>478</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am just asking the question to have it brought out definitely and beyond mistake?</question>
  <answer>Well that is all right. Yes sir, there are circumstances, - there has been times when revelations were revealed to a few persons, and it thereby became a law to them, but not a law to the church until it is revealed to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>479</questionnumber>
  <question>Now suppose that a revelation should be accepted by a few people before it is made known to the church, and that revelation is contrary to the doctrines of the church, - it it is true that it is obligatory on the few people to whom it is made known, and it is contrary to the law of the church as accepted by the church, - what position would these few people be in?</question>
  <answer>Well in rather an unpleasant position.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>480</questionnumber>
  <question>They would be in a position of violating the law of the church wouldn't they?</question>
  <answer>No sir, no sir, - not necessarily.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>481</questionnumber>
  <question>They would not?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is immaterial, not proper re-cross examination and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>482</questionnumber>
  <question>Would not they be liable to be dealt with, to be disciplined?</question>
  <answer>Well they might be like in the instance of the persons who revealed the plural marriage doctrines on revelation before it was announced to the church, and practiced it, - their position would be delicate, but it is not for me to question the matter or the position they would be in, for it would be the Lord's business and He would probably see them through safely. It is the Lord's business. It is not mine or yours. If the Lord had revealed to Joseph Smith to take a certain course, as he had to John the Revelator, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>483</questionnumber>
  <question>Well suppose the Lord had not revealed it, - suppose the Lord had not anything to do with it, - what then?</question>
  <answer>Well it would be a bad case.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>484</questionnumber>
  <question>That would be bad you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I speak thus because of your supposed unbelief in these matters, for I believe that the Lord did reveal it to him, so I think that all who accepted it are in no danger from the wrath of the Lord at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>485</questionnumber>
  <question>Who were the officers of the church just prior to the death of Joseph Smith, or at the time of his death?</question>

  <question>Well you know who it was Mr. Snow, so just name the man?</question>
  <answer>Name him? Thunder, do you think I am able to name him now. Didn't I tell you I couldn't do it, and don't know that if my memory did not fail me now that I could do it. It is not on my mind just now and I can't do it. Mr. Cannon, can't you name the?</answer>

  <question>Was he restored at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir,-yes sir, he was restored at that time. He was restored just a short time before his martyrdom.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>500</questionnumber>
  <question>There is no question about that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is right,-it was Joseph Smith, and Hyrum Smith and Sydney Rigdon composed the presidency at that time.</answer>

  <question>They formed the first Presidency?</question>

  <question>What made him the next highest office in the church in point of authority?</question>
  <answer>
    Well sir, I am able to enlighten your mind o that subject and I am glad to be able to do it. I am glad that I can. Brother Joseph Smith or a bishop or any one who has or had great responsibilities restin upon them growing out of the duties of their office, had the right to select two counselors, and they had the right to select them themselves, and those two counselors have no authority other that to act as counselors to that person, whoever he may be, or whoever his office may be,-that is all the authority they have,-and when that person dies, whether he is the president of the church or simply a bishop or whatever he may be,-those counselors are sim-

    </pagenumber>ple selected to act for him during his life-time, and as soon as he is withdrawn from that office by death or otherwise, his counselors have nothing more to do with it, -that is the end of their connection with it.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>507</questionnumber>
  <question>Was not Hyrum Smith, when hew as set apart as counselor to the President of the church, also made President, revelator under the apostle?</question>
  <answer>Well probably he was appointed a prophet, seer and revelator, but not as a President, - well yes he was too, when he was ordained as Counselor.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>508</questionnumber>
  <question>Well at the death of Joseph, would not he hold the same office, - except that he would no longer be Counselor?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>509</questionnumber>
  <question>He would not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, - not for one moment.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>510</questionnumber>
  <question>Would not he have the right to preach the gospel?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. And he could have baptized for the remission of sins, and possibly he would have baptized you, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>511</questionnumber>
  <question>Well possibly I would not need to be baptized. I was baptized, for remember my father was President of a Stake in Illinois at the time he died?</question>
  <answer>Well that is possible, I am glad to hear it and from that fact I am bound to think a great deal of you on account of whatever other good qualities you may be possessed of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>512</questionnumber>
  <question>So you find that the three highest officers in the church at that time were Joseph Smith, the President of the church and his two counselors, Hyrum Smith and Sydney Rigdon, the three together composing the First Presidency of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. They were at the time of his death, - during the occupancy of that position just before his death.</answer>

  <answer>After their death?</answer>

  <question>The remainder of them would not have been dead?</question>
  <answer>I thought your question assumed that they were dead.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>518</questionnumber>
  <question>I said, suppose the majority of them had been killed would the remainder of them still have held their offices?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and they would have been the higher authority, - the highest authority after the dissolution of the first Presidency.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>519</questionnumber>
  <question>They could not have acted as a quotum because they would have been in a minority, - wouldn't that have been the case?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>520</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was not that the case with Sydney Rigdon, - he could not act as ahe quorum of the First Presidency, and at the same time he held a certain high position there?</question>
  <answer>No sir, he did not, - the cases were entirely different, for the twelve apostles were not appointed as Counselors. They were not appointed as Counselors at all, - not to act as Counselors particularly, but they had a certain authority given them with their apostleship, which continued with them as apostles as long as they continued in life.</answer>

  <answer>Well where there is any matter of that importance, a person never receives any position of that kind unless there is a revelation calling them to it. A person never receives a position of that kind unless the appointment is dictated by the Sprit of God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>561</questionnumber>
  <question>is that all the way you know it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not altogether, for I know it by the Spirit that is within me, that tells me it is a fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>562</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the way you know it?</question>
  <answer>That is the way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>563</questionnumber>
  <question>You know it by the spirit that is within yourself, that they were called by a revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I know they were called by a revelation dictated by the spirit of inspiration.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on this matter on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial and moves the court to strike from the record all the evidence of this witness on that point.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>564</questionnumber>
  <question>Now is it not a fact to your knowledge that there was no revelation at all calling them to the Presidency?</question>
  <answer>
    You asked me if there was a Presidency formed, and I told you that I did not know, and then you inquired further, and I told you that I understood from reports and what I saw that there was a Presidency formed, but I would not say positively that I knew it, - but that the information

    </pagenumber>was just as good as knowledge. Now I do now know these things of my own knowledge, for I was not present at the time, but I have heard that it was as I have stated, and I consider my information fully as good as positive personal knowledge, - at least it is as satisfactory to my mind as personal knowledge. Now when President Young and these Counselors were appointed, - that is were appointed to the First Presidency, the Spirit of the Lord manifested to them that they were to do this work, and they went ahead and did it.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>565</questionnumber>
  <question>And you know that only from their statement in the matter?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not wholly in that way. I know it from their statements that is true, but I also know it from the same principle in the same way that I know the bible is true, and that I know that the Twelve Apostles lived and did as they are recorded as doing, and that the Son of God was on earth and made manifest in the flesh to the world, - it is the Spirit that manifests to me that these things were true. Now this may not be entirely satisfactory evidence to you, sir, but it is to me.</answer>

  <question>Well is that Spirit recognized in a Court of Justice?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I am sorry to say it is not.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the last question asked the witness to which an answer was given, on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, and moves the Court to strike the same from the record for the reasons above given, together with the answer thereto.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>568</questionnumber>
  <question>Now suppose another man has testimony from the Spirit to the effect that they were not called, and goes on the witness stand and swears to it, would not that be just as good testimony as far as the Court is concerned as what you have given?</question>
  <answer>No sir for it would be entirely contrary to the course that is pursued in putting men into these offices or positions.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>569</questionnumber>
  <question>Would it be contrary to putting that man into that position?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>570</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will ask the question again? Suppose another man claimed to receive a revelation, - a testimony to himself, - that Brigham Young and his council were not called by a revelation, would that fact be a principle that could be received as evidence here?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and moves the court to strike from the record any answer that the witness may give to the question on the same grounds.</mono>
  <answer>I don't know what would be a proficient evidence here, - I am simply telling you of the facts, and do not propose to sit in judgment on what would or would not be evidence.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>571</questionnumber>
  <question>Would it be competent evidence or not?</question>
  <answer>We have a way by which we determine whether that would be a revelation or not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>572</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question. Would that be competent evidence?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question sked the witness on the ground and for the reasons that it is incompetent and irrelevant and immaterial, and it calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>I am not here to judge what is competent, or what is incompetent.</answer>

    </pagenumber>and competent to ask the witness these kind of question, and I object to this kind of an examination and to each and every question asked the witness here-to-fore and here-after, on the ground that it is not competent, relevant or material to any of the issues involved in this case, and is improper cross examination; and there is no issue in this case which would render such an examination competent. By the Examiner, - "If I properly understand my duty here in taking this evidence, it is not my place to pass upon the competency, relevancy or materiality of any question that may be asked, nor to pass upon the question as to whether or not any question is pertinent to the issues involved. That I take it is something entirely outside of my duty or authority in taking this testimony. Of course I may have my opinion on the subject, but this is not the time or place to express it, therefore I decline to do so. Of course if a question was asked that was flagrantly outside of the issues. I might refuse to compel the witness to answer it, - but in that case I could only announce my position by committing or refusing to committ the witness for his refusal to answer it. I may be mistaken in my position, but that is the way I look upon it. By Mr. Kelley, -

  <question>I believe the examiner is correct in his position. Now I believe Mr. Snow, that after the taking out of the three apostles there were only six left of the old apostles?</question>
  <answer>I think so. Yes, that is right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>574</questionnumber>
  <question>That would not form a quorum would it, Mr. Snow?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>575</questionnumber>
  <question>How would that be done?</question>
  <answer>It would form a quorum in connection with the First Presidency. And further I will say, that if there was not one single one of those six apostles left, the First Presidency could transact business without them.</answer>

  <question>Are you through with your answer?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>They would not form a quorum independently of the First Presidency?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>580</questionnumber>
  <question>The six themselves could not do business as a quorum for the church themselves, could they?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not the six that were left, - they themselves could not do business as a quorum, but it could do business in connection with the First Presidency of the church just as well as if it was full.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>581</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you understand they would do business in connection with the First Presidency as an independent quorum?</question>
  <answer>Because the First Presidency has a right to take part in and preside over all the affairs of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>582</questionnumber>
  <question>You mean the First Presidency could?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Well now just wait a moment. Now I say that without further thought I could not say whether they were appointed before or after the First Presidency was appointed or organized. As it is I do not know, and I would not know under the circumstances anyway.</answer>

  <question>Now in your re-cross examination, you were asked the question if Hyrum Smith was not ordained a seer and revelator when he was counselor to Joseph Smith and I will ask you to state whether or not he was not ordained a prophet, seer and revelator in connection with the office of patriarch?</question>
  <answer>He might have been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>589</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you state it as a fact that he was ordained to the office of prophet, seer and revelator, while he was a counselor to Joseph?</question>

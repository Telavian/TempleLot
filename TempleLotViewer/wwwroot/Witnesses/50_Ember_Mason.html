  <answer>Yes sir it runs in my had that there was a fence there, but it is so long ago that I can't remember distinctly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>19</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you know of any such a fence being there prior to the war?</question>

  <answer>On the south side. It was on the left hand side going west from here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>23</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you think that that fence extended south west to in the neighborhood of where that bridge is at the present time?</question>
  <answer>Well I think it did. I would not be sure, but I think it did go down to pretty near it. Maybe it did not go as far as that, - I would not be certain as to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>24</questionnumber>
  <question>About how far was it from that point going east to where the temple lot now is? That is where the temple lot that is not fenced is?</question>
  <answer>Well I suppose it is about three hundred and fifty yards to the lot from where the bridge over the railroad now is. I think it was about that far from there to the bridge that is over the railroad track now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>25</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you mean that by coming up to the west side of the temple lot as it is fenced now, or coming up on past the temple lot altogether?</question>
  <answer>Well coming this way from the bridge it is about three hundred and fifty yards I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>26</questionnumber>
  <question>Well would that bring you to this side of the Temple lot as it is fence in now?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>27</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>30</questionnumber>
  <question>Well approximately about how far would it be?</question>
  <answer>Well I say I don't know for I never measured it or stepped myself, and so I cannot say exactly. I think it is about three hundred and fifty yards, - maybe a little more or a little less up to the west side of it</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>Well coming on up this way past the temple lot, the distance would be as much greater than the distance you have designated as the temple lot is wide or long, - the distance would be the length of the temple lot greater, coming in this direction to the east fence of the temple lot? It would be that much more than three hundred and fifty yards to the east side of it from the bridge?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>32</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now, Mr Mason, do you know how far that fence extended from that bridge this way, with reference to the temple lot?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know exactly, but I think the fence run plum up this way past the temple lot as it is there now, and then down that way, and fenced in a part of the town there, but I would not be certain about it, for I don't remember distinctly how is was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>
  <question>But you think the fence came up to this side of the temple lot where it is now?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is leading.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am only making it clear what the witness means in putting the question that way?</question>

  <question>How is your hearing, - can you hear well?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not very well you will have to speak loud if you want me to hear you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>38</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I asked you how far this way with reference to the temple lot as now fenced, that fence on the south side of the Westport road extended?</question>
  <answer>Well I cannot answer that question because I don't know how far it extended.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>39</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did it or did it not extend along the side of the road, and along the side of the lot, as it is now fenced?</question>

  <questionnumber>42</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, beginning at the bridge there over the Missouri Pacific and coming this way along the road, are you sure there was a fence there at any time?</question>

  <answer>A stone fence.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>48</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you state positively with reference as to whether or not that fence extended east this way, so as to extend past the present ground called the temple lot?</question>

  <questionnumber>49</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now if it did not, - well now if that fence extends east this way as you suggest, was there not another fence attached to it some where running east and west, and extending up this way further to the east?</question>
  <answer>There might have been.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons that it is leading.</mono>
  <answer>Well sir I can't answer that question for I don't know how that is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>50</questionnumber>

  <question>It inclosed a field?</question>
  <answer>It did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>55</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there a fence there at any time before the war that made an enclosure?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question on the ground that it is leading.</mono>
  <answer>Well of course it did I suppose. I don't know that I was ever all around it, but they had stuff there growing in it, - Woodson did after they got it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>56</questionnumber>
  <question>Now was or was not this fence you have testified about a fence on the side of a field?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I think it was. It had the appearance of being fenced in like a field.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>57</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now with reference to this stone fence that you speak of, was or was not that a side of a field?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>

  <questionnumber>58</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I mean by a field, - an enclosure?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I understand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>59</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was or was not this stone fence you spoke of a part of the fence around an enclosure?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know. I know that it fenced off the temple lot or a part of it any how, and perhaps the whole of it from the road. I suppose they fenced up as much of it as they could.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>60</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it a large field or a small field that was there?</question>
  <answer>Well it was a pretty large field I should think for it was about all of that south of this Westport and Independence road. I don't know how far down south it extended, but it seemed to me to be a pretty large field that was there. You understand that, don't you?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>61</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, I think I do.</question>
  <answer>Well go on and ask me questions and I will answer them. I am getting old, and I am not going to stay here all day.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>62</questionnumber>
  <question>What was that field cultivated in?</question>
  <answer>Well it was grass sometimes, and it was pasture sometimes.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>63</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recollect the number of acres there was in that field?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>64</questionnumber>
  <question>Well give us your best recollection as to the size of the field with reference to the number of acres there was in it?</question>
  <answer>I don't know anything about the number of acres there was in it at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>65</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did that field extend south of where the Missouri Pacific railroad is now, or did it, - was it north of where the Missouri Pacific railroad is not?</question>
  <answer>
    Well I don't know but I think that
    <pagenumber>
      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0002_f0005-Pages_685-737-ORIGINAL/6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 689</a>
    </pagenumber>the present Missouri Pacific railroad is not far from the south side, from where the south side of that field was. That is my idea of it, but I would not be positive.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>66</questionnumber>
  <question>Now where was the north side of that field?</question>
  <answer>I think the road there made the line.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>67</questionnumber>
  <question>You think the road made the line?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>68</questionnumber>
  <question>You mean the Westport road?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I think that was the north line of that enclosure.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>69</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now can you give me any idea as to where the east line of that field was, - if there was a big filed there can you give me any ideas to where the east line of it was?</question>
  <answer>No sir I can't.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>70</questionnumber>
  <question>Well can't you give an approximate idea as to where the east line was?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I cannot, and I have passed it thousands of time I might say, - well hundreds of times any way, and yet I can't tell you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>71</questionnumber>
  <question>Well can you answer this question, -?</question>
  <answer>I say I can't tell you where it was, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>72</questionnumber>
  <question>Well wait until you hear my question and probably you can answer it, - Was the east line of that field or enclosure, west or east of the present enclosure know as the temple lot?</question>
  <answer>The east line of the temple lot?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>73</questionnumber>
  <question>Now this is it, - was the east line of that enclosure you have been speaking of, west of the present enclosure known as the temple lot, or was it west of it?</question>
  <answer>I don't know. I can't say whether it came past the west side of that lot as at present enclosed or not. Possibly it did, but that is something I can't say. You know all that ground down there was called the temple lot once, and is yet called the temple lot or ground by a good many. The whole piece of ground, - the whole enclosure there was always called the temple lot ever since I have been in this country, and a good deal more ground down there as well.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>74</questionnumber>
  <question>Well can you tell me some body that lived in there prior to the war?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know that I can. Let me see, - Poole lived down there some where.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>75</questionnumber>
  <question>What is that?</question>
  <answer>There was a man named Poole lived down there somewhere, but to save me I do not remember what time that was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>76</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know that he lived on that piece of ground that was fenced there?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say as to that I know he lived there north of the railroad, and I believe that he did live on that land.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he inside the field or enclosure?</question>
  <answer>Well the fact is I do not know whether he was or not. I can't say as to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>78</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how long ago was that?</question>
  <answer>I can't say what year it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>79</questionnumber>
  <question>About how long ago was it?</question>
  <answer>Well I reckon it was forty five or fifty years ago, - maybe more, may be less, but I think it was that long ago any way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>80</questionnumber>
  <question>That mans name you saw was "Poole"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>81</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you know any body else that lived in there?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't remember. If there was any one else lived there I have forgotten them now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>82</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know to whom that property belonged at the time you speak of, - that is at the time it was fenced as you have stated?</question>
  <answer>They said that Woodson owned it, but I don't know that he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>83</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know who built that stone fence there?</question>
  <answer>Sam Woodson had it done. I know that he got the rock over there where Chrisman's house was burned, right pretty near south of, the church there</answer>

  <questionnumber>84</questionnumber>
  <question>Was the quarry - there where Chrismans house was, or was it south of where the house was?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know just where it was, but it was some where in that neighbourhood.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>85</questionnumber>
  <question>And the rock for the fence was taken from that point?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Some where near there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>86</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you see them when they aere building that fence?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I saw them for they did not build it in a week, - they were quite a while building it, - I can't say how long.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>87</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you see Woodson there in colnection with the building of that fence?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I saw him there occasionally. I saw him there several times.</answer>

  <question>And it was moved?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>93</questionnumber>
  <question>What part of it was moved prior to the war?</question>
  <answer>That part of it that was right along the road out here sir</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>94</questionnumber>
  <question>Well aint that the fence along the Westport road, - it was a part of that fence that was moved?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>95</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what part of it as near as you can remember, was it that was moved?</question>
  <answer>I think that part on the north side next to the road.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>96</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you mean to say that the end of the fence this way, that is the north east end of it was moved?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>97</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the end that was moved?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>104</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is it Page's blacksmith shop that you refer to?</question>
  <answer>I don't know his name. I can't say what his name was for I never had any work done there, but it is right opposite the, - it is right beside the depot there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>105</questionnumber>
  <question>It was moved on the road where the blacksmith shop is situated?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>106</questionnumber>

  <question>The road divides it?</question>

  <question>Well did you ever see anyone working there?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't think that I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>139</questionnumber>
  <question>You never did see anyone working there?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't know as I did. I saw them building the fence there, and maybe you call that working.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>140</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did that fence that you have spoken of, come up between that temple ground and where the church is now?</question>

  <question>That is that the fence that Woodson built came up to the west end of that temple lot that is fenced there now?</question>

  <question>Well will you swear that the fence did come up to there?</question>
  <answer>No sir I could not do that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>154</questionnumber>
  <question>You could not swear that it came up that far?</question>
  <answer>No-sir, for I don't remember just where it did come, as it has been so long ago, but I remember that there was a fence there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>155</questionnumber>
  <question>That ground has always been known as the "temple lot" ever since you have been in the country has it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I heard of it before I came here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>156</questionnumber>
  <question>It has never been known by any other name since you have been here?</question>
  <answer>That is the name it had cone by, - as the temple lot or temple ground.</answer>

  <questionnumber>159</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when you first came here in 1833 was the ground where this temple lot is, - the ground that is and always has been known as the "temple lot", - was that timbered land or prairrie land, or both?</question>
  <answer>Well it had most of it been timbered land I think, but at that time the timber was mostly cut off it. Most of it was any way.</answer>

  <question>Most of the timber had been cut off it?</question>

  <question>That was when you first came here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>162</questionnumber>

  <answer>Well along this street out here, - the "Westport Road" as it was called, the timber was pretty well cut off it when I came here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>163</questionnumber>
  <question>How far back from the road was the timber cut off it if you know?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know. I can't say. There was scattering trees on it of course, but I can't say how far back the timber had been cut off it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>164</questionnumber>
  <question>Now in reference to this fence, -is it not a fact that there was just a fence run around a part of this land for the purpose of pasturage, and that it was never farmed in the sense that we mean when we say a piece of land is farmed?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say, I know what farming is, but I don't know whether that was farmed or not. I said that before, but I know there was grass on it, and I think at some time there was some wheat grown there, but as to that I would not be positive. I remember though that there was grass there, for I recollect seeing them cutting grass there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>165</questionnumber>
  <question>And they did not turn their cattle in there to graze?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, of course they did. I don't know that I ever remember seeing cattle pasturing in-there but it is reasonable to suppose that if they had it enclosed that they would put their cattle in it and not let the pasture go to waste.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>166</questionnumber>
  <question>They did turn cattle in there to graze?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I suppose so for if you had a piece of land that was fenced you would pasture your stock on it or farm it if you saw it was fit for farming.</answer>

Now on this 7th day of July 1892 at the hour of 10 o'clock A.M/ come the parties herein as aforesaid, and the further taking of the depositions herein is continued, pursuant to adjournment. By Mr. Southern, "It is admitted I believe that the King James translation of the inspired scriptures, and the translation of the same made by Joseph Smith, are introduced in evidence". By Mr. Kelley, "It is admitted that parts of them are, not all of them". By Mr. Southern, "I think I can show you from Joseph Smith's testimony that they were put in bodily". By Mr. Kelley, "No we claim that they were not offered in evidence, they were simply offered at that time for the purpose of identification, and that was all. We offered it for that purpose and nothing else so that they could be used as evidence or any part of them after that time if we saw fit to introduce them or any part of them. At the time we simply desired the witness to identify the books referred to, and that was all." By Mr. Southern, "Defendants now offer in evidence from the king James translation of the Holy Scriptures marked exhibit "C", and from exhibit "D", entitled the "Holy Scriptures, translated and corrected by the Spirit of Revelation, by Joseph Smith, Jr the Seer", published by the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,

    </pagenumber>date of publication 1867, as follows, - from King James translation marked exhibit "C", Exodus 32 chapter, 35th verse, the words "and the Lord plagued the people because they made the calf which Aaron made". And also from exhibit "D" from the 32 chapter of Exodus, the 35th verse, the words "and the Lord plagued the people because they worshipped the calf which Aaron made." By Mr Kelley, - I move to exclude the testimony offered because it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and I make the further objection that there is no witness on the stand, wo whom questions are propounded nor to read the testimony sought to be introduced". By Mr Southern, - "All right. If you are willing to stand on that objection I am. I also offer from exhibit "C", Genesis 9th chapter, 5th verse as follows, " and surely your blood of your lives will require it, and at the hand of ever beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every mans brother will I require the life of man". Now I will read from exhibit "D" I will read the same chapter and verse. I will ask you to read it Mr Kelley, -" By Mr Kelley, - "And the Lord spake unto Noah, and he blessed him.

By Mr E.L Kelley, - "I think I can find what you want Colonel if you will let me have the book I will see if I can't find what you want. I think you will find it in the 11th and 12th verses of the same chapter". By Mr Southern, - "Well read the 11th and 12th of that chapter". By E.L. Kelley, - "And surely blood shall not be shed, only for meat, to save our lives; and the blood of every beast shall I require at your hands. And whoso sheddeth man blood, by mans shall his blood be shed; for man shall not shed the blood of man". That answer to it I think." By P.P.

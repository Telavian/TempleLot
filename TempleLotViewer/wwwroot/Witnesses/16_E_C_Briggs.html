  <questionnumber>46</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you if the basis of the church, —the basis adopted by the church at that time, has ever been changed since that time</question>
  <answer>No sir. It was understood there at that time, and recognized that any body who had ever united to the church, or with the church and had not been expelled or dis—fellowshipped from the church, still belonged to the church, and that was the only test that was required when they joined the re–organization.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, —"We object to that question and to the answer of the witness for the reason that it calls for an opinion of the witness who has not been shown to be an expert, and on the further ground that the answer is not in response to the question, and ask that it be stricken out for that reason".

  <question>You say January 19th 1841 is the date of the revelation from which you have just quoted the extract?</question>

  <questionnumber>193</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>194</questionnumber>
  <question>Now will you state another revelation that you saw in that publication, the "Times & Seasons", or heard read to you?</question>
  <answer>Why I don't remember now to give the date. All the book of covenants, more or less, was published in that either in a general way from time time, or in that history of Joseph Smith, or the history of the church, and also in the Millenial Star. It is all in there more or less, and up to the time of his death there was his general history published in the Times & Season and Millenial Star, and by the way there is some other papers published that is in also.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>195</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now these are all the revelations that you can mention that you learned about, from the Times & Seasons?</question>
  <answer>I can't remember independently, but I know there were some of them there, and I think they were all there from time to time, - that is at one time or another they were all published. I think there was nearly one hundred from, - one hundred of them I should say in that history.</answer>

  <question>Were those letters considered or held as an authority in the church?</question>
  <answer>Well they were never received as we know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>215</questionnumber>
  <question>Were they considered or held as an authority on that subject in like the other revelations in the book of Doctrine and Covents. They were letters written to men in the city of Nauvoo at the time, and were published. He was not in the city of Nauvoo at the time for those letters were addressed to men there in Nauvoo.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>216</questionnumber>
  <question>Well they were regarded as expounding the doctrine of baptism wee they not? The doctrine of baptism for the dead, and the manner in which it would be performed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>217</questionnumber>
  <question>Expounding it for whom, - for whose benefit?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>219</questionnumber>
  <question>The time that you read or heard read these revelations was from 1842 through 1843 and in 1844 down to the time of the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That is the time that I have more particularly in mind.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>220</questionnumber>
  <question>Now while you were speaking of the revelations that were reported in the Times & Seasons, do you remember seeing a revelation that purported to have been given on Fishing River, generally referred to as the "Fishing River revelation"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I think so. I think that is the title of it. If you will give me that book I will tell you all about it in a minute.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>221</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you are testifying now and not the book?</question>
  <answer>Well I know, but it is rather hard to answer these questions, for I never thought of them in this light before you know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>222</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you give me the date of the Fishing River revelation?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't think I can.</answer>

  <question>Now you have testified to the doctrine of the church, from what you have read?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>226</questionnumber>
  <question>Now can you give me the revelation?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I can give you the revelation or even the gist of the revelation, but I know there is such a revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>227</questionnumber>
  <question>But you can't give the substance of it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for I have forgotten it, or can't bring it to my mind any how.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>228</questionnumber>
  <question>I refer to the Fishing River revelation?</question>
  <answer>I understand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>229</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you state how much there was of the revelation, - whether there was a small single paragraph, or several paragraphs?</question>
  <answer>I think there was several paragraphs.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>230</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember by whom what revelation was given?</question>
  <answer>It was given through Joseph Smith I suppose. All of those revelations were given through him, or nearly all, - some of them were given in connection with other parties.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>231</questionnumber>
  <question>Was, or was not that Fishing River revelation given on June 22nd 1834?</question>
  <answer>I cannot tell you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>232</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, what is your best impression as to that?</question>
  <answer>I couldn't tell you that sir, for I haven't my dates, - the dates and times that these revelations were given, - that is something I haven't in my mind at the present time. I remember some of them, but not all or anywhere near all of them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>233</questionnumber>
  <question>When were these revelations delivered, - in 38, 41 or 42, - these revelations in 1842, - given in 1842, - were they published in any other publication besides the Times & Seasons, and if so in what publication or publications?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not cross-examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>234</questionnumber>
  <question>I will modify that question, - when were they published in any other form, if they were published in any other form?</question>
  <answer>They were published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and some of them is what is called the Book of Commandments.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>235</questionnumber>
  <question>When were they published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>In 1835.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>236</questionnumber>
  <question>I am talking about the revelations of 1841, 1842 and 1843, and the revelations of 1838 also, - when were they published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>I don't know when they were published. I suppose though they were published when the next edition came out, - whenever that was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>237</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I want to get you to state what edition they were first published in?</question>
  <answer>Well the last Nauvoo edition that I remember of seeing published was published in 1845, and they were in that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>238</questionnumber>
  <question>They were in the Nauvoo edition of 1845?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>239</questionnumber>
  <question>Were they in any edition prior to that time?</question>
  <answer>I don't think the 1841 revelation was in that. I don't think it was ever published in the book of Covenants until 1845, - that is if it was I don't remember of ever noticing it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>240</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you know what is meant by the "rejection of the church"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>241</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you know, - that is the question Mr Briggs, and not what you think, - do you know?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>242</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is meant?</question>
  <answer>The dis-organization and rejection of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>243</questionnumber>
  <question>Has that a meaning with reference to the church at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>It had reference to the church as an organization, and the effect of the dis-organization was to disorganize it as a body or as an</answer>

  <questionnumber>244</questionnumber>
  <question>Or-ganization.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>245</questionnumber>
  <question>Has that term any special reference or significance in connection with any event that occured to the church at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>I don't know as I understood that question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>246</questionnumber>
  <question>I say has the phrase "rejection of the church", any meaning as applied especially to any event or incident in connection with the church at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>That took place?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>247</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>248</questionnumber>
  <question>What incident would it refer to?</question>
  <answer>It refers to the fact that if under certain conditions they did not do a certain work, they should be rejected as a church with their dead.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>249</questionnumber>
  <question>At what date did that take effect?</question>
  <answer>The time of the rejection?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>250</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know what date they were rejected. The understanding that we have always held, or at least I have is that it signified that at the time the church was dis-organized, then it was rejected.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>251</questionnumber>
  <question>Then when was it disorganized?</question>
  <answer>I think June 27th 1844.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>252</questionnumber>
  <question>Are any revelations according to the doctrines of the church which you know represent, considered binding, without they have been bound and place in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>253</questionnumber>
  <question>They were not considered authoritive in the church to which you now belong unless that is done?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>254</questionnumber>
  <question>Were these revelations of which you speak in 1841 and 1842, - you also spoke of a revelation given in 1853?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I spoke of a letter written in 1842 by Mr Smith expounding the book of covenants, and it was also in the book of covenants published later, and in the Times A Seasons at that time. I referred to letters from Mr. Smith, in which he gave his instructions touching the matter or subject of baptism. That is what I referred to.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>255</questionnumber>
  <question>Were those letters considered authoritive in the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>256</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you know whether they were considered authoritive in the church at the time they were written?</question>
  <answer>I know they were never received as authority according to the best information I have had. They were never received as an authority in the church to my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>257</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you say they were not received as authority?</question>
  <answer>I say they were not to the best of my knowledge and belief, and I am quite positive they were not. If they were I never heard any thing of it, and I don't think they could be without my knowing it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>258</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know whether they were considered as expounding the truth of the church?</question>
  <answer>No doubt they were wise instructions? We so hold them to be wise instructions.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>259</questionnumber>
  <question>They expounded the truth?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, upon the question of baptism they do, and that doctrine we hold to be the truth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>260</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you hold that to be the truth still in the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>We hold them to be wise instructions, but we have not as yet received them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>261</questionnumber>
  <question>do you hold the exposition as there given as the truth, - do you so hold it now in the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>We never received any revelation when receiving these instructions, and we therefore do not receive them in any other light than as wise instructions, we do not receive them or regard them in the nature of a revelation or anything of that kind.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>262</questionnumber>
  <question>Were those letters ever place in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but not as a revelation.</answer>

  <questionnumber>263</questionnumber>
  <question>When were they placed in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>In 1845, - I think that is the date of the edition in which they are first found.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>264</questionnumber>
  <question>Was the book of Doctrine and Covenants ever adopted?</question>
  <answer>Prior to that time it had been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>265</questionnumber>
  <question>Had been what?</question>
  <answer>Had been adopted.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>266</questionnumber>
  <question>Prior to what?</question>
  <answer>Prior to that time it had been received and adopted by the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>267</questionnumber>
  <question>When was it that it was received by the church?</question>
  <answer>In 1835 it had been received by the church. That was the time that the most of the revelations were received for nearly all of them had been received before that time, - there was only three or four received after that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>268</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now Mr Briggs what I want to get at is what book of Doctrine and Covenants, were those letters first published in?</question>
  <answer>It was in 1845. Now that is my memory. If my memory serves me right, that is the date of the book.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>269</questionnumber>
  <question>Now was that book published in 1845 ever adopted by the church in any way?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>270</questionnumber>
  <question>It was not?</question>
  <answer>No sir. it could not have been for the reason that the church as a church had been rejected prior to that time. The church as an organization had been rejected at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>271</questionnumber>
  <question>Then if any of your brethern have at any time during the progress of this investigation, presented that book published in 1845 as an authority in the church as published, what do you say to that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>272</questionnumber>
  <question>They have made a mistake?</question>
  <answer>Thet have never presented it, so there has been no mistake.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>273</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I say, if they have, they have made a mistake, haven't they?</question>
  <answer>I think so. I don't think any one that is posted in our church would do that, and so I say the book has never been presented here in that way, - that is as a authority in our church. Of course there is a great deal, - nearly the whole of the matter contained in book of doctrine and Covenants is contained in that book also. -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>274</questionnumber>
  <question>Well we are speaking of what it contains, - particularly the revelation of 1841?</question>
  <answer>The letters of Joseph Smith were never presented to the re-organized church as an authority, and were never recognized by it as an authority.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>275</questionnumber>
  <question>So then, you state here that the book of doctrine and covenants of the 1845 edition was never accepted by the re-organized church as an authority, and has never been adopted by the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir it has never been adopted and accepted as an authority.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>276</questionnumber>
  <question>In neither the old church, or the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for the church was rejected at that time. It was published under the auspices of the Twelve in 1845, and at that time the church had been rejected.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>277</questionnumber>
  <question>The book of 1845 was published under the auspices of the Twelve.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>278</questionnumber>
  <question>What Twelve?</question>
  <answer>The twelve that had formerly been in the old organization before it was rejected.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>279</questionnumber>
  <question>The same Twelve who at that time were claiming that they were the old organization?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I suppose so. They claimed that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>280</questionnumber>
  <question>They made that claim then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir and they make it yet I understand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>281</questionnumber>
  <question>They claim that yet?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>282</questionnumber>

    This rejection of the church of which you speak expresses the

    </pagenumber>view of the re-organized church?
  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>283</questionnumber>
  <question>And not the view or opinion of the Twelve under whose auspices the book of doctrines and covenants of the 1845 edition was published?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper cross-examination.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff moves the court to exclude the answer of the witness from the record for the reasons given in the above objection, and on the ground that it is not the best evidence, but is only the opinion of the witness, who is not authorized to speak for the re-organized church.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>284</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr Briggs if the book of Doctrine and Covenants of the 1845 edition was approved, - was not approved by the church, I should say, except as you have stated, - what books of doctrine and covenants with their dates, prior to that time were approved?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that the same is incompetent irrelevant and immeterial, not cross examination, and calls for an opinion of the witness only.</mono>
  <answer>I stated that I did not recollect that the revelation of 1841 was ever published in the book of of covenants until 1845. Now that was or had been added to a volume that was known as the book of covenants that was published in 1845 but I don't know that the revelations of '38 or 1841 had ever been published in that form in the book of covenants prior to that time. The first time that I ever saw it was in an edition published after the rejection of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>285</questionnumber>
  <question>That was what was called the edition of the book of covenants of the edition of 1845?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>286</questionnumber>
  <question>Now if you don't regard the edition of 1845 as having been adopted by the church, what book of Doctrine and Covenants prior to that time, do you regard as having been adopted by the church?</question>
  <answer>That is easily stated.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>287</questionnumber>
  <question>Well state them?</question>
  <answer>Those that were adopted by the church prior to the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, - or rather those that were published by the church prior to that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>288</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was prior to 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>289</questionnumber>
  <question>Up to that time or year?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, if there was any publication in that year.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>290</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now as you have been in the ministry for so long a time you have testified, and these books you regard as the foundation of your faith, can't you state at what date these books of doctrine and covenants to which you do hold as having been adopted by the church, were adopted by the church?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember that there was any edition published as I have already stated from 1835 unto 1845. Now I do not say there was not any published during that time, for there may have been, but if there was I do not know of any.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>291</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know of any edition after or between the edition of '35 and the edition of 1845?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>292</questionnumber>
  <question>After the edition of 1835, the nest edition was published in 1845?</question>
  <answer>yes sir, and there was only two or three revelations after that if I remember right?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>293</questionnumber>
  <question>After what?</question>
  <answer>
    After 1835. There was one in '38 and one in 1841, and perhaps one in '37. There was one then I think if I am remember

    </pagenumber>right.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>294</questionnumber>
  <question>What does that one given in 1837 refer to?</question>
  <answer>It has reference to Thomas B. Marsh I think, and I think the date was 1837. If I remember right that is the date, and it was published in the Times & seasons and the Millennial Star.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>295</questionnumber>
  <question>What revelation was that?</question>
  <answer>The revelation to Thomas B. Marsh.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>296</questionnumber>
  <question>What is the substance of it?</question>
  <answer>I can give you one idea regarding it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>297</questionnumber>
  <question>Well please do so?</question>
  <answer>Let me see if I can get that in mind. In speaking of the quorum of Twelve, and of their temptation and hardness of heart, it says "after their temptations and much tribulations, behold I, the Lord will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts and stiffen not their necks against me they shall be converted, and I will heal them". That was after their temptations and trial, and spoke of something in the future.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>298</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you take that revelation to refer to the Quorum of Twelve in Nauvoo in 1845, and it was put in this book?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they put that in there with the rest of them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>299</questionnumber>
  <question>You take it to refer to the same quorum of twelve that afterwards went to Salt Lake City?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, some of them went there but it was not the quorum, or the majority of the quorum as a quorum that went to Salt Lake.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>300</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it not a majority of the quorum that went?</question>
  <answer>No sir for it was disorganized as a quorum at that time. I told you that before.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>301</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that of course is merely your claim, that is the view of the reorganized church, and not the view of the quorum, and was not their view at the time?</question>
  <answer>And they claimed it too. They claimed it also for at the reorganization some years afterwards up at Kainesville they took three out of their quorum for instance there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>302</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did not nine of them leave there together, and go to Salt Lake City?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>303</questionnumber>

  <question>You do not assert that positively?</question>
  <answer>I do sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>306</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know their standpoint?</question>

  <questionnumber>307</questionnumber>
  <question>From whom did you get the record?</question>
  <answer>From the published statements and the history of it as it occurred.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>308</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr. Briggs you have spoken of what you call and term a "reorganization" in 1851, and you have also stated that the doctrines of the reorganized church were precisely the same as the doctrines of the church termed the old church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>309</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what you testified to?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>310</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will ask you if that reorganized church, afterwards adopted the book of Doctrine and Covenants, that is, adopted it after the reorganization as you term it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>311</questionnumber>
  <question>When did it adopt such a book first?</question>
  <answer>The reorganized church adopted the book of Doctrine and Covenants for what it purported to be, and the standard books of the church, the Book of Mormon, the Bible and book of Doctrine and Covenants were adopted as the standard books of the church, the same as they had been in the original church, and that was done at the first conference of the reorganized church in 1852.</answer>

  <questionnumber>312</questionnumber>
  <question>And did it adopt the book of covenants?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>313</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did it adopt the book of doctrine and covenants and everything contained in it, that was adopted and published by the twelve after the rejection as you term it in 1845?</question>
  <answer>They adopted what purported to be the book of doctrine and covenants as recognized in the history of Joseph Smith written during his life time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>314</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did they adopt everything contained in that book of Doctrine and Covenants published in 1845 to which reference has been made?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>315</questionnumber>
  <question>They did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, they paid no attention to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>316</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did they leave out?</question>
  <answer>They adopted it in so far as it purported to contain the revelations of Joseph Smith as contained in the edition of 1835, and the revelations that Joseph Smith by his published writings recognized to be his revelations. They did not adopt it in its entirety or indeed any portion of it, but they adopted the book of 1835. What I mean to say is that there was very little difference between the edition of 1845 and the edition of 1835, as there has been only three or four revelations given between these dates and the ones given of course after 1835 were in the 1845 edition, but as it was published after the death of Joseph Smith, and after the rejection of the church, of course the reorganization did not recognize it. The reorganized church I might say just take that 1845 edition for what it is worth without any reception or rejection about it, they simply accept it for what it is worth as they do his letters, and not as an authority or law unto the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>317</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they or did they not in adopting what was contained in that book of 1845 adopt the revelation of 1841 of which you have spoken, the revelation of 1838 of which you have spoken, and the letters of Joseph Smith of which you have spoken?</question>
  <answer>They adopted it for just what it is worth, just what it shows itself on its face to be. If you desire to have it in that way, there was no formal adoption about it, nor was there any formal rejection, but it was accepted for what it was worth, and nothing more.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>318</questionnumber>
  <question>Just the same as the afoted or accepted anything else in the book?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for they did never accept these letters of Joseph Smith at all. These never have been accepted, that is these letters, for they have never been accounted as an authority like the revelations.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>319</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did they make an exception of these letters?</question>
  <answer>They adopted it as purporting to be the word of the Lord, simply that and nothing more.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>320</questionnumber>
  <question>As published in that book?</question>
  <answer>Well as purporting to be the revelations of Joseph Smith. There is somethings in there that were published afterwards, that Joseph Smith never saw or heard of and they did not accept them. I wish to be understood as saying that whatever was in the book that was in conformity with the other accepted utterances of Joseph Smith upon which the church had passed was accepted, in other words the book was taken for what it purported to be, and nothing more than that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>321</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then you have a book of doctrine and covenants in the reorganized church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>322</questionnumber>
  <question>It is the book adopted in 1852?</question>
  <answer>Well we did not adopt, I mean we did not publish any edition then. We just accepted the revelations as published. You see the history of these revelations is in these papers as published by Joseph Smith himself. It is in those papers that I referred to, and the revelations are found there altogether.</answer>

  <questionnumber>323</questionnumber>
  <question>Right there Mr Briggs I will ask you this, - was ever a revelation an authority in the church that was not found in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>324</questionnumber>
  <question>Then do you state that these revelations which you saw, - the revelation of 1841, - the revelation of '38, and any others that may have been given, and which were not in the books of doctrine and covenants during the life time of Joseph Smith, were or were not authority before they were published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>No sir. What was published in the Times & Seasons before Joseph Smith's death wae not regarded as an authority until they are found here in this book.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>325</questionnumber>
  <question>And if any other resolutions had been found in the Times and Seasons, and not published in any book of doctrine and covenants, prior to the date of 1845, or that edition of the book of doctrine and covenants, were they considered to be, and were they in fact an authority for the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, they were not. I am not aware there was any, - if there was any, they were nit recognized as an authority.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>326</questionnumber>
  <question>What did it take to constitute them as an authority?</question>
  <answer>What?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>327</questionnumber>
  <question>A revelation as an authority?</question>
  <answer>To be passed by the general rule that they had.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>328</questionnumber>
  <question>How was that done?</question>
  <answer>I think it was first passed by all the quoroms, and I do not know to what extent, - by the way I believe the history of it is all given, for they were passed through all the quoroms.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>329</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not publish a book of doctrine and covenants in 1852?</question>
  <answer>How is that?</answer>

  <question>More than one?</question>
  <answer>Do you mean by the re-organization?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>337</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>I think there has been two perhaps. I know there has been more than one since that for there has been additions made to it since then, for we have had several revelations that are published in the book of doctrine and covenants, and to use an old phrase of the original edition published by the re-organization, I guess there has never been but one plate made or published.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>338</questionnumber>
  <question>There has been several revelations given since 1860?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir, but their claim does not make that so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>390</questionnumber>
  <question>Neither does the fact that you dispute their claim render them not the true successor to the old church?</question>
  <answer>That is a matter of opinion and evidence.</answer>

  <question>I say if it is as you say a fact that the re-organization does not recognize ordinations made in these different factions of the church between 1844 and 1852, was Jason W. Briggs ever ordained an high priest, - was he ever ordained to the high priesthood?</question>
  <answer>How is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>404</questionnumber>
  <question>Was your brother Jason W. Briggs, ever ordained to the high priesthood?</question>

  <question>What was the next revelation given after that to the reorganized church?</question>
  <answer>The next one is the one to the President of our church, Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>414</questionnumber>
  <question>The next one was given to the President of the church, who was Joseph Smith the present President of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>415</questionnumber>
  <question>Then was there a hiatus of seven or eight years or more, in which there was no revelation given?</question>
  <answer>There was no revelation given as commandments to govern the church. They were receiving revelations from many of the Saints, but not any that were given as commandments to the church, or which were accepted by the church as commandments governing it. I mean to say they were not so received. We believe in continued revelations, that each one may have manifestations of God's will and special revelations.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>416</questionnumber>
  <question>Did any of these revelations you have just described become authorities in the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>417</questionnumber>
  <question>Were they recognized as doctrines of the church or for the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>418</questionnumber>
  <question>Were they recognized as manifesting the doctrines of the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>419</questionnumber>
  <question>Were they recognized as expressing the law or doctrine of the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>420</questionnumber>
  <question>So then you don't call to mind any revelation excepting these two in the reorganized church, until the time that the revelation commended to come through he President of the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir and those revelations spoken of were never received by the church as authority, like the law that was to govern the church for its government.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>421</questionnumber>
  <question>When was that revelation you speak of received by the President of the church?</question>
  <answer>Which one?</answer>

  <question>Well it was either in 1860 or 1861?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was in 1861 I think.</answer>

  <question>Is that authoritative?</question>

  <question>What was that in reference to Mr Briggs, - according to the best of your recollection?</question>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds it is irrelevant, incompetent and immeterial, not the best evidence, and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I presume it was, if it is there. I remember there was several revelations given but I can't recall the dates, or where they were all given.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>444</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you say there was one in 1890?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons as set forth above.</mono>

  <questionnumber>446</questionnumber>
  <question>If there was one given in 1882, and one in '87, and one in 1890 are they in the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>I think they are in there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>447</questionnumber>
  <question>Are they as authoririve as any other revelations in the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think so. We so regard them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>448</questionnumber>
  <question>If the fact beas you have stated it Mr Briggs, that these revela- which you remember, and other which you think may have been given which you do not remember since 1844 at Nauvoo, or since 1851 or 1852 at the re-organization, - how can you swear that the doctrines of the re-organized church at the present time, are the same as were the doctrines or the old church from 1830 to 1844?</question>
  <answer>I have been well acquainted with the doctrines of the church since the first, - I heard of it and was very much interested in it from the first, - after the third sermon I have paid very close attention to it, and have had very close interests and associations with it from that day to the present, and I thinl I am qualified to speak regarding it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>449</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr Briggs I believe you want to answer my question but you haven't don't so?</question>
  <answer>Very well sir, I will do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>450</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you regard that as an answer to be question?</question>

    </pagenumber>the doctrine of the church, known as the old organization?
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>451</questionnumber>
  <question>No sir that is not quite my idea, just repeat the question to the witness (speaking to the Notary). The following is the question referred to, "If the fact be as you have stated it Mr. Briggs, that these revelations which you remember, and others which you think may have been given, which you do not remember since 1844 at Nauvoo, or since 1851 or 1852 at the reorganization, how an you swear that the doctrines of the reorganized church at the present time, are the same as were the doctrine of the hold church from 1840 to 1844?</question>
  <answer>The epitome of faith of the church under its old organization is the same as that of the reorganization, touching the primary principles of the doctrine. What I first heard and believed of the old organization I now believe; and it has been the teachings of the church all along, therefore I can swear I know them to be the same and identically the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>452</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your answer to the question asked you?</question>
  <answer>It is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>453</questionnumber>
  <question>Then do you swear that the doctrines of the revelations since 1944, and since the reorganization in 1852 are the doctrines of the church, or were the doctrines of the old church, from 1830 to 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, there has been no conflict since.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>454</questionnumber>
  <question>Then do you, then if there was a revelation at Fishing River, was that a doctrine of the church from 1830 to 1834?</question>
  <answer>What is the date of that revelation?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>455</questionnumber>
  <question>If there was a revelation given on Fishing River in 1834, was that the doctrine of the church from 1830 to February 1834. If there was a doctrine at Fishing River, given in a revelation in June 1834, was it the doctrine of the church from 1830 to February 1834?</question>
  <answer>There may have been an item, given there that was not in it before. It certainly wouldn't have been the doctrine of the church before it was given, but if that is the case it was in harmony and not in conflict with anything that went before.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>456</questionnumber>
  <question>Then if there was a revelation given in 1835 of 1838, was it a doctrine of the church from 1830 to 1835?</question>
  <answer>In harmony, but not in conflict.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>457</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it a doctrine of the church from 1830 to 1835, that is the question for you to answer Mr. Briggs?</question>
  <answer>Well as far as I know, there might have been more light thrown on the revelation that had been given prior to that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>458</questionnumber>
  <question>There "might have been"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and there is no doubt but that there was. These revelations you will find are all in harmony and do not conflict.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>459</questionnumber>
  <question>Now if there was a revelation about the building of the temple given in 1841, was that an authoritative revelation of the church prior to that time, and binding upon the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Do you refer to the temple at Nauvoo?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>460</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>No sir, there was no authority for building the temple at Nauvoo, prior to that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>461</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now if there was a revelation given in 1838 about tithing and other things?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, there was one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>462</questionnumber>
  <question>Which afterwards became a binding law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>463</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that revelation a binding law upon the church prior to that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but there was a detail in 1838 expounding the law that was to come, but which was not to be in conflict with anything given before.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>464</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Now if there was a revelation by Deams or Briggs, or anyone else in 1851 or 1852 or 1853 about the reorganization of the church

    </pagenumber>was that a doctrine of the church prior to 1844?
  </question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>465</questionnumber>
  <question>It was not a doctrine of the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but they were in harmony with what had been given before that time. They were all in harmony, one with the other.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>466</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you state that a doctrine which recognized a disorganized church was in harmony with the doctrine of a church which had not been disorganized?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>467</questionnumber>
  <question>You state that as a fact?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, in exact harmony and agreement with them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>468</questionnumber>
  <question>Now if there was a revelation in 1860 and 1861 given by Joseph Smith, and one in 1865 also given by Joseph Smith, one concerning the colored race, and another one in 1873, and still another one in 1890, all by Joseph Smith, were these identified with the doctrine of the church, of the old church from 1830 to 1844?</question>
  <answer>In harmony with it?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>469</questionnumber>
  <question>I ask you if they were identified in doctrine with the doctrine of the old church from 1830 to 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>470</questionnumber>
  <question>They are?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir in doctrine they are identical.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>471</questionnumber>
  <question>They are identical in doctrine with the old church from 1830 to 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>472</questionnumber>
  <question>Were there any revelations such as these I have mentioned as having been given since the reorganization of the church, given prior to the time that these respective revelations were given?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I presume not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>473</questionnumber>
  <question>Were there any revelations given on the subject of these revelations, prior to the time when these revelations were given?</question>
  <answer>Why they did not convey these same ideas in the same clothing, but it was in harmony with what has been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>474</questionnumber>
  <question>Well let me see if I can get your meaning; is this what you mean by "harmony"? That when it is established that there shall be a revelation, that revelations may be given by the President of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>475</questionnumber>
  <question>And that all subsequent revelations are in harmony?</question>
  <answer>All that are given that are in harmony with the past, may be of Divine origin, and the ones that conflict with it wouldn't be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>476</questionnumber>
  <question>Would the enlargement or development of a principle, be identical with the doctrine of the same principle before it was enlarged or developed?</question>
  <answer>The constitutional principle upon which the church is founded is the continued revelations, and if it did come that they didn't have any, the denial of it would be a denial of the doctrine. We believe in continued revelation in other words, and that was the doctrine of the old church, and is the doctrine of the reorganization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>477</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the claim or position of the reorganized church, as you have stated it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>478</questionnumber>
  <question>A doctrine of continuing developing revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>479</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that not also the doctrine of the Utah church?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know as they have had any.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>480</questionnumber>
  <question>I say, the question is, is that not the doctrine of the Utah Church also?</question>
  <answer>I know they claim.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>481</questionnumber>
  <question>Who claims?</question>
  <answer>I know the Utah Church claims or its Presidency does, for I heard him make this statement, "I am not a prophet or son of a prophet", and I never heard of a revelation from him, or say one that purported to come from him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>482</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question, is it not also the claim of the Utah Church?</question>
  <answer>What?</answer>

    </pagenumber>was not also a claim of the Utah church. You stated that it was a doctrine and belief of the re-organized church, - this doctrine of continuous developing revelations, and I ask you now if that is not also the doctrine of the Utah Mormon Church?
  </question>
  <answer>They may claim that obey believe in revelations, but they never claimed that I know anything of that they received them I never seen or heard of a revelation that was published by them, as they claimed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>484</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that the Utah Church bases itself upon the revelations received at Nauvoo, and prior to the assembling of the church at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>I know them claim to be the continuing church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>485</questionnumber>
  <question>Based upon the Nauvoo church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and the book of Mormon and the bible.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>486</questionnumber>
  <question>And the book of covenants?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and the book of Mormon and the bible. They claim that as the foundation of their faith, - that is I suppose they do, for I have heard so, and I never heard anything to the contrary.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>487</questionnumber>
  <question>You have spoken about having enlarged what was done in 1852 at the re-organization?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>488</questionnumber>
  <question>Now was this not done, - a revelation was passed that the re-organized church would take the bible, the book of Mormon and the book of doctrine and covenants as the basis of it faith?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is irrelevant and immeterial, not the best evidence, and not cross-examination.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>489</questionnumber>
  <question>That was done?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>490</questionnumber>
  <question>What book of doctrine and covenants did it refer to?</question>
  <answer>It referred to the one in existence, the only on in existence that had been issued by the original church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>491</questionnumber>
  <question>This 1845 edition?</question>
  <answer>They received that for just what it purports to be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>492</questionnumber>
  <question>It was this edition of 1845?</question>
  <answer>They did not receive all that was written in that as standard.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>493</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they make any exceptions in any thing?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>494</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they make any exceptions of record, - did they do that by the records?</question>
  <answer>It was generally understood that they received that which was revelation, and that which was not revelation they did not accept. They did not claim that it was all revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>495</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there such a resolution in the record of their conference of 1852, - which passed by the conference of 1852, - is there such? Is there such?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>496</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir? Is there such a resolution to be found in the record of that conference of 1852?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir there is a resolution which was passed, which recognizes the bible, the book of Mormon and the book of doctrine and covenants, - the standard book and excluding all other works. They did not recognize any other revelation that could not be found in these books as standards of the church.</answer>

  <question>Was such a resolution entered in the minutes of the record of the conference of 1852?</question>

  <question>Did not the reorganized church at that time when it passed that resolution recognizing that book of Doctrine and Covenants, did it or did it not recognize that book of Doctrine and Covenants of the 1845 edition when it passed that resolution?</question>
  <answer>No sir they did not recognize it as the book of Doctrine and Covenants, but did not especially recognize that book.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>499</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they take all that was in it in the endorsement?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>500</questionnumber>
  <question>Then if that is the case, what Book of Covenants did it take?</question>
  <answer>It took the revelations found recorded up to the date of 1844 at the time of the prophets death, and no other revelation was accepted. I should say it took the revelations found recorded up to 1835, and no other revelation was accepted after that date, but the one of 1841, and nothing after that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>501</questionnumber>
  <question>Then haven't they since 1852 included in their book of Doctrine and Covenants everything that was in the book of Doctrine and Covenants of 1845?</question>
  <answer>It is possible, it is likely, but I don't remember as to that either. I guess likely it has been but I do not remember as to that positively. I know now that they haven't for those letters are in there and they were never accepted as authoritative by the reorganized church, and there is a letter in there I think speaking of the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, and that has never been recognized as an authority or doctrine by the reorganization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>502</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now then, if you have got all of the book of Doctrine and Covenants of the 1845 edition in your subsequent editions of the books of the Doctrine and Covenants issued by authority of the reorganized church, is it not a fact that you don't believe everything that is in your book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>503</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it a fact that you do believe it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that is not a fact neither. Neither are facts. There are some things in there that are not accepted as the doctrine of the church? There is matter in there that the church has never declared upon. It is a matter of fact though that we receive these revelations, and what purports to be revelations for what they purport to be, and nothing more, and no others are standards or authority for the church. That is just the way that matter stands, we accept these things, for what they purport to be, and they are not standards or authority for the church at all, for the church has never passed upon them that I am aware of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>504</questionnumber>
  <question>Has not the reorganized church declared solemnly in its conferences one or more times, that it recognized all that is in the book of Doctrine and Covenants as authoritative?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>505</questionnumber>
  <question>That is not a fact?</question>
  <answer>No sir it is not a fact for there are several lectures in there that have never been accepted by the church or recognized as authority.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>506</questionnumber>
  <question>What are they?</question>
  <answer>They are on faith. They are the lectures delivered to a class at Kirtland, Ohio.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>507</questionnumber>
  <question>Are they included in the book of Doctrine and Covenants now?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I presume so, though I saw an edition that did not have them in.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>508</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you see that?</question>
  <answer>I saw that since I came here to conference.</answer>

  <questionnumber>509</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not state in the outset of your examination in chief here, that the re-organized church was based upon the doctrines contained in the bible, the book of Mormon, and the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>510</questionnumber>
  <question>You stated that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I state it now. Now if you will allow me to complete my answer I would like to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>511</questionnumber>
  <question>Very well Mr Briggs, I have no desire to interfere with your answers when they are responsive to the questions I ask you, and when you fail to answer my question I have a right to interrupt you and try to attract your attention to the fact that you are wandering from the subject. Now do you desire to answer any fuller than you have done already?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I wish to say that the doctrine and covenants proper we recognize that as an authority, - that is the part in which purports to be the revelation, but you must remember that there are these letters and lectures in there, which do not purport to be revelations, and that part we do not recognize as being authority. We recognize them simply as containing good advice and being a guide to us, but we do not recognize them in the light of an authority binding upon the church as a law. We do not accept them as being a law of authority, but accept them simply for what they purport to be, the effusions of men by way of advice or instructions to the church, and in that light they are accepted, but in no other.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>512</questionnumber>
  <question>Then do you accept anything in the book of doctrine and covenants that does not purport to be a revelation?</question>
  <answer>In what way?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>513</questionnumber>
  <question>As doctrine, - do you accept it as a doctrine, - that is anything that does not purport to be revelations?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>514</questionnumber>
  <question>As the law of the church, do you not accept it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not as a law to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>515</questionnumber>
  <question>I refer to yourself personally, - do you accept it?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>516</questionnumber>
  <question>What is the attitude of the church on the same question?</question>
  <answer>The church does the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>517</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you think as the church does on that question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. And on all others I hope.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>518</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know that there is a section in the book of doctrine and covenants on marriage?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I am familiar with that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>519</questionnumber>
  <question>In which it is stated that one man shall have but one wife, and a woman but one husband?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>520</questionnumber>
  <question>You know that?</question>
  <answer>I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>521</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is that authoritive?</question>
  <answer>It is recognized as one of the sections upon which the church has declared as authoritive.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>522</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then how would you answer my question as to whether it is authoritive or not?</question>
  <answer>That is what would e called a ritual of the church. It don't purport to be a revelation at all, but is simply what might be called a ritual of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>523</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what would you say in reference to its being authoritive on the church? That is the question?</question>
  <answer>It is one of the rules by which the church is governed. It is a ritual of the church, and one of the rules that governs the church on on the question of marriage.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>524</questionnumber>
  <question>What would be your answer as to its being authoritive in the church?</question>
  <answer>It is authoritive as a rule of government, but not as a revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>525</questionnumber>
  <question>Then is it an authoritive in the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, as a rule of action or ritual in the church for the regulation of marriages and it was so recognized by the church in solemn assembly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>526</questionnumber>
  <question>Then is it a revelation?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  <pagenumber>
    <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0007-Pages_413-502-ORIGINAL/44.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 452</a>
  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>527</questionnumber>
  <question>Then why do you say the book of doctrines and covenants containing only the revelations?</question>
  <answer>I did not say so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>528</questionnumber>
  <question>You swear that you did not say the book of Doctrine and Covenants only the revelations?</question>
  <answer>I did not say that. The book of Doctrine and Covenants contains many things besides revelations. It contains the law of God in the form of revelations and in the form of certain rules for the government of the church which have been adopted by the church and received its approval in conformity with the laws of God as laid down in the revelations. We recognize the Book of Doctrine and Covenants as containing a part of the law of God, what is necessary for the guidance and government of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>529</questionnumber>
  <question>Then is it not a fact that you do not recognize this section here on marriage as a law of the church?</question>
  <answer>We recognize it as I have stated repeatedly, - as a rule governing the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>530</questionnumber>
  <question>It is not a revelation?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and it don't purport to be a revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>531</questionnumber>
  <question>Then are not these other sections in here, which are not revelations, just as authoritive as that on that?</question>
  <answer>On what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>532</questionnumber>
  <question>That section on marriage?</question>
  <answer>No sir not all of them. Some of them are, and others are not. For instance there is a letter in relation to the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, written by Williard Richards and John Taylor. Now that has never been accepted by the church, but it published in the edition of 1841. Neither in language or in spirit had it ever been accepted by the church, but it is put in there simply as a historical account of the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, and for what it purports to be. You will observe that it was in the interim between the time of the death of Joseph Smith and the re-organization of the church that it was put in there by the rejected church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>533</questionnumber>
  <question>When this doctrine of monogamy, as I will call it, which permits a man to have but one wife, and a woman but one husband, you you recognize that as the law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>534</questionnumber>
  <question>Although it is not a revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - it has been accepted as the law of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>535</questionnumber>
  <question>Then this doctrine of monogamy as set forth here, is a rule adopted by the church for its government, and not a law from God?</question>
  <answer>It is not a law or revelation from God directly, but it is in harmony with revelations from God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>536</questionnumber>
  <question>It is in harmony you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>537</questionnumber>
  <question>But it is not a revelation?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and it don't purport to be a revelation either, but we understand that it is an exposition of a revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>538</questionnumber>
  <question>An exposition of what you deem to have been revealed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>539</questionnumber>
  <question>Now if a revelation were to be made from a recognized source, or to come from a recognized source, a revelation contrary to this rule for monogamous marriage, and advancing the doctrine of polygamy, would it, or would it not behold authoritive, or more authoritive than this rule set forth here?</question>
  <answer>It would not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>540</questionnumber>
  <question>It would not?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>541</questionnumber>
  <question>And why not pray?</question>
  <answer>Because it would be rejected.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>542</questionnumber>
  <question>Rejected?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - by the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>543</questionnumber>
  <question>But in answer to that?</question>
  <answer>Sir?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>544</questionnumber>
  <question>But there is another question following that, and it is this, - what would the church do about it?</question>
  <answer>It would be a false revelation, and the church would not accept it.</answer>
  <pagenumber>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>545</questionnumber>
  <question>It would be a false revelation even though it were adopted, and accepted by the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>546</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your position?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it would not make any difference it would be false, and the acceptance of it by the church would prove that the church was in apostasy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>547</questionnumber>
  <question>It would prove the church would be in apostasy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>548</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your opinion is it not?</question>
  <answer>That is the fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>549</questionnumber>
  <question>To whom would it prove that?</question>
  <answer>To any one that knew the situation. It would prove it to any one that knew the situation of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>550</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you have spoken of progressive revelations?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>551</questionnumber>
  <question>You recognize that doctrine?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>552</questionnumber>
  <question>And so does the re-organized church.</question>
  <answer>That is my understanding.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>553</questionnumber>
  <question>Well according to the doctrine of progressive revelations there my be other revelations still on these subjects?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that is the principle upon which the church is founded.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>554</questionnumber>
  <question>Now if one of these revelations should o me, and prove to be the same doctrine as prevailed under which David and Solomon and others had plural wives, why would you reject it?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is in competent irrelevant, and immeterial, not cross-examination and is untrue in fact, as no such a doctrine ever prevailed at the time reference to.</mono>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>555</questionnumber>
  <question>Suppose a revelation came under the idea of progressive revelations, - suppose it came and it taught the same doctrine as it taught David and Solomon in the days when they had more wives than one, how would you regard it?</question>
  <answer>David and Solomon it is declared in the book of Mormon, which is recognized as one of the first authorities in the church, - it is declared that in the book of Mormon that David and Solomon practiced whore-dom in having more than one wife, and having concubines.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>556</questionnumber>
  <question>Then David and Solomon are rejected by the book of Mormon?</question>
  <answer>In that respect they are rejected, and they are denounced as being wicked. Their practice is denounced, and they are under the condemnation for it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>557</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it the same with Abraham?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that the same is incompetent irrelevant and immeterial, not cross examination, "and it is not true that Abraham had more than one wife".</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>558</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it the same with Abraham?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - it is the same in the book of Mormon with all who practiced it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>559</questionnumber>
  <question>How would that be with reference to Jacob then?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons as above set forth.</mono>
  <answer>It would be the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>560</questionnumber>
  <question>It would be the same with reference to Jacob?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>561</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now, at the out set of your examination Mr Briggs you mentioned as being present at the re-organization of the church at Beloit, - First I will ask you if you claim it was first organized at Beloit?</question>
  <answer>That was the time they had the first general conference of the re-organization.</answer>

  <question>Several men and women who had been members of the old church, you stated were there at the conference?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>566</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I want you to state, - and I think my friend over there will consider it a fair cross-examination, - at least I hope he will, consequently, all who were members of the old church, who were present on that occasion?</question>
  <answer>I was notified last Saturday that they wished me to come there, and I thought this very question would be asked me, so I tried to note down all these things I could remember for the purpose of refreshing my memory if it would need refreshing, and I have the notes here now. If you will accept it I can just put it in that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>567</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is not what I want, - I want to accept your memory, as that would be the best evidence?</question>
  <answer>Well go ahead.</answer>

  <answer>J.W. Briggs; Silas H. Briggs; David Powell; William Hartshorn; Polly Briggs; - I guess that is all the members of the old organization of the church that was present.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>572</questionnumber>
  <question>So that is all that you can remember at this time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - no, there was John Williams, and Henry Pease. I don't remember any other men that were at that conference. There was others there of course but at this time I cannot remember who they were. If their names were called off I might remember more, but I cannot from memory recall any more at this time I don't think. Now I am simpky giving you the names of parties that were there that I remember, but there was others there. As to the women or wives of the men whose names I have given you, I cannot remember their names.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>573</questionnumber>
  <question>Well are you assuming that the women, or wives of the men that were there, were members also?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>574</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know that they were members of the church also?</question>
  <answer>Well I know they were.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>575</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you go on and give any of their names you can?</question>
  <answer>Louise Briggs, and there was Mrs David Powell, - I don't know her other name, nor Mrs William's name, - I don't remember her name either; there was Polly Briggs, but you gave her name, - Now that is all the names I can give you that were there at that conference, and I said there was others there, but I don't remember their names.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>576</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr Briggs you have made an effort to call up in your memory the names and the number of persons who were there at that conference in 1852, who had been members of the church prior to 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, of course as I said that was not all that was there, but that is what that I can recall at this time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>577</questionnumber>
  <question>That is all you can remember at this time after having made the effort?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>578</questionnumber>
  <question>And after making this effort, all you can recall is the number of eleven persons, - the names of eleven persons?</question>

    </pagenumber>but I cannot recall their names? There was a great many more there of the old members than I have mentioned you must remember.
  </answer>

  <question>How many were there in that branch?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember how many, but there was quite a good many.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>580</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say there was branch of the church there at Beloit at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>581</questionnumber>
  <question>How could there be a branch of the church there at that time when the church was dis-organized?</question>
  <answer>That branch was organized there in 1851 just as soon as this revelation came directing the saints to erect their altars and seek the Lord, and live their religion, and the Lord would bear testimony.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>582</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know whether any of the members of that branch were members of the church at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>I don't think so. I do not think they ever lived at Nauvoo any of them, - there might have been some of them lived in Nauvoo, but I think not, and they had been members of the church in the old days before the dis-organization. I know that to be the fact for I was brought up there amongst them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>583</questionnumber>
  <question>Could you give me the names of as such?</question>
  <answer>These are the names I have given you already, but there was a number of others, members of the branch that I don't remember, for I was young and small at the time, or a very young man, and so those are the only names I can call up now, but there were others connected with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>584</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not mean to be understood here as saying there was a stake at that place that continued from 1844 up to that time?</question>
  <answer>I say there was a church and branch organization that continued from 1844 up to that time, - it was there before that time in fact, - I can't say how long before 1844 it was established there, but it was some time before.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>585</questionnumber>
  <question>When was it organized?</question>
  <answer>I said I did not know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>586</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe you stated it was organized in 1851?</question>
  <answer>It was organized before that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>587</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it was dis-organized again in 1851, - is that it?</question>
  <answer>The dis-organization effected them as quoroms but where ever there was a branch any where in the world, that kept contact, the love of their religion they were still the church, where six or more of them members, maintained their organization. There was one for instance down near Alton, that Elder Green had charge of, and it kept its organization from the time of the dis-organization of the church until the re-organization. It kept its local organization all the time. 588 (Written as 888)</answer>
  <question>Who had charge of the branch you speak of at Beloit?</question>
  <answer>Jason W. Briggs was the presiding elder of that branch at Beloit.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>589</questionnumber>
  <question>Had he been so prior to 1852?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>590</questionnumber>
  <question>For how long a time?</question>
  <answer>He had been presiding elder for years and years before that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>591</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there any such an organization any where else than at Beloit?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, several of them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>592</questionnumber>
  <question>Where?</question>
  <answer>Where was branch organizations at Waukeshaw, but I do not know the status of how it had been all the time along, but I do know in 1851 after this revelation was given that that branch turned all over.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>593</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was at Waukeshaw?</question>
  <answer>Well it was the branch there, - I don't know ho belonged to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>594</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was the head of it?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not say who was the Presiding officer.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>596</questionnumber>
  <question>Where was William Smith's branch?</question>
  <answer>Well William Smith came up in there, and preached for a time, and they recognized him, but he did not go to work and organize a branch as I understand it, but he was there as I understand it, preaching and teaching the doctrine of lineal priesthood when he came up there, and for some reasons they rejected him. Now I was not connected with that in any way, and hence can only speak of it from hearsay, for I never met him there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>597</questionnumber>
  <question>Didn't the branch so called, of which you speak, and of which you you say Jason W. Briggs was President, or which was led by him belong to the William Smith organization?</question>
  <answer>Well they recognized William Smith as a preacher, but when he made some claims which they did not agree with, and then they got this revelation to reorganize.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>598</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was not Jason W. Briggs one of William Smith's apostles?</question>
  <answer>Well I rather think he was, but I could not say he was ordained by William Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>599</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was not William Smith, and his organization amongst the rejected of the church, was it not included in the church that was rejected?</question>
  <answer>William Smith was gathering up these old members of the church, and preaching lineal priesthood.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>600</questionnumber>
  <question>That is not the question Mr Briggs, —you have not answered the question. I have asked you if his organization, —the organization that recognized William Smith as its leader, was not that amongst the rejected of the church?</question>
  <answer>Well no, for he was preaching amongst the scattered members of the old organization, and gathering them together, and he came around teaching the doctrine as taught by his brother Joseph, and when he made some extravagant claims they simply denounced him at Beloit and Waukeshaw, and wouldn't have anything more to do with him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>601</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was it denounced him?</question>
  <answer>Jason W. Briggs.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>602</questionnumber>
  <question>Was not this organization you speak of, of which Jason W Briggs was the leader, at Beloit, Wisconsin, identified at one time with the Strang faction of the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>603</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you swear they were not?</question>
  <answer>No sir,I don't think they were. They had this association with Strang. A man by the name of Phineas Wright, came from Voree, —that was the Strangite headquarters, —and he put the claim forward for Mr Strang, he put forward the claim, for I remember it as well as if it was yesterday, —that Strang was the successor of Joseph Smith, and my brother said "well it is all right if he is", and he said "well let us take your name and if he is carrying on the work just as Joseph did, we have no objection to it". Now that was all there was to it, for I remember distinctly of this man Phineas Wright coming up there, and what took place. Of course I do not pretend to give the exact identical words that were used, but it was substantially as I have stated it. There was no vote taken, or anything of the kind to receive them, —that is to receive my brother in among the Strangites, and he never was a Strangite, unless that would make him one, which is not the case, according to y way of looking at it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>604</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he ever a William Smithite?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>605</questionnumber>
  <question>Then he was never at any time either a Strangite or a William Smithite?</question>
  <answer>No sir. He recognized William Smith as teaching the gospel. He taught lineal priesthood, and he was the first man that ever taught that there.</answer>

  <questionnumber>606</questionnumber>
  <question>He taught the doctrine of lineal priesthood, - that is the doctrine of lineal descent as applied to the priesthood?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir and that was the first time that that doctrine had ever been taught in that section that I know anything of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>607</questionnumber>
  <question>Well didn't he teach some other doctrine there that was objectionable?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>608</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know it is a fact that he did teach some other doctrine there at that time that was objectionable?</question>
  <answer>Well yes he did teach something that they did not approve, for that is the reason they rejected him. After this time this revelation was given, and in it the doctrine of lineage was advocated, and it was accepted by the re-organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>609</questionnumber>
  <question>By whom was William Smith rejected?</question>
  <answer>Well everybody that knew him, and worked with him, - His co-adjuators so to speak.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>610</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was it rejected him?</question>
  <answer>Those that had before that time accepted him as a minister.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>611</questionnumber>
  <question>That was by this re-organization in 1852?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. The minutes of the resolution are there where they rejected all who pretended to be successors of Joseph.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>612</questionnumber>
  <question>By whom was Strang objected to?</question>
  <answer>This resolution covered all kinds, and rejected all who pretended to be prophets as pretenders, and denounced them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>613</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now, is it not a fact that the Conference of 1852 was made up of men who belonged to the William Smith organization, and men who belonged to the Strang organization, and men who had belonged to the Briggs organization, and men who belonged to other scattered organizations?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for my brother Silas was one who had never untied with any of these organizations. He had never united with any of the different factions at all for he always held to the one view to the day of his death, and never joined any of them. They had some of them been associated, - that is they had recognized the, and suppose they were carrying out the ends of the re-organization, before they knew of the rejection, when they had always stood on the principles of the doctrine as taught in the original church and while they attended the meetings of the different factions or organizations, they were not what you would call either Strangites, or William Smithites, or any of the rest of the, - they were simply people who had remained steadfast in the faith and did not recognize any of these different factions as being the true church, although they might from time to time attend their meetings. My brother Silas was one of these. Now there was Zenas H. Gurley who had been with the Strang faction, and he denounce Strang when he saw that he was making innovations, - he denounced him as an imposter.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>614</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now as to the fact as to whether Strang did make innovations or William Smith made innovations, - do you mean that the charge that these innovations had been made, was made by Jason W. Briggs?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>615</questionnumber>
  <question>By whom was it made, - the charge made?</question>
  <answer>By a general resolution in the conference it is asserted that he had made innovations and is denounced as an imposter, they were denounced as imposters, - all who make innovations in the doctrines of the church, or in practice.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>616</questionnumber>
  <question>That appears by resolution?</question>
  <answer>It was decided by a resolution of that conference to be the fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>617</questionnumber>
  <question>What conference was it?</question>
  <answer>
    The conference in 1852, and that resolution recognized all members who had ever belonged to the

  <question>What are the facts about that Mr Briggs?</question>
  <answer>The facts are simply these, - that there was a branch of the church there and William Smith came up there among them preaching the doctrine of the church, and while there they accepted him as a minister, and after he left there some developments were brought to light, the consequence of which was, that they rejected him as a spiritual teacher.</answer>

  <question>The local branch I should say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it rejected him as a spiritual teacher.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>626</questionnumber>
  <question>When was that?</question>
  <answer>That was in 1851. There was a large branch there at that time, and I have only given you a few names of the members that belonged to it, - I can't recollect them, - I cannot bring them to memory now as I would like todo, and would if I could. That was quite a long while ago, but I knew these names that I gave you, - that I knew the parties personally.</answer>

  <questionnumber>631</questionnumber>
  <question>What organization, if any, at that time, did this particular branch at Beloit have any connection with?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't what what you mean? I can't say for I do not understand your question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>632</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you what particular branch or organization did this branch that you say was established at Beloit at that time have any connection with?</question>
  <answer>Well no church or organization but the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, -that was of course before the re-organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>633</questionnumber>
  <question>Only with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>634</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that in existence at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <answer>Well I don't know whether it was organized, that is the branch, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>636</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you to what time you reffered in your testimony when you say the branch at Beloit belonged to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?</question>
  <answer>I can't give you the date when it was first organized, but there was a branch there organized, and continued along all the time, part of the time it was very active and part of the time not so active.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>637</questionnumber>
  <question>Now what the time you referred to prior to 1851 or 1852?</question>
  <answer>In 1851 the first communication was received, in which the doctrine of lineage and succesorship was established, pointed to that which culminated in the re-organization. They had quite a large branch there, and they at once accepted that revelation, and stood upon that revelation as the basis upon which they warded themselves against every pretender to the Presidence of the church, and have decided upon the sucessor of Joseph Smith, -his eldest living son, as being entitled to the Presidency of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>638</questionnumber>
  <question>That organization at Beloit, they called that a local organization or branch?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>639</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I would like to know with what other branch or branches, that branch at Beloit had communication or connections? If there was nay such I would like to know what they were?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir there were others. There was one at Waukeshaw, and there was one in Voree. I don't know the numbers that belonged to these branches, but I know there was quite a number at Waukeshaw, and a good many of the members of the branch there were relatives of mine, and so I know more about that than the others. The fact that there were releatives of mine there is the reason I know so much about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>640</questionnumber>
  <question>No you haven't got my question exactly it seems?</question>
  <answer>What is the question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>641</questionnumber>
  <question>Did the branches at Beloit, of which you speak, have any relations with any of the other branches, if there were any other branches any where else?</question>
  <answer>Well they were independent branches, all of them. Thet were all independent branches and had no communal connection in the way of uniform identification one with the other, but at the time of this conference of course there was representatives from all of them assembled there.</answer>

  <answer>Up to that time,-</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>643</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there any connection between these branches?</question>
  <answer>
    They were acting as individual branches I suppose every where, -wherever there was any. In 1852 at that conference, there was resolutions passed there to recognize all the branches, wherever six or more members assembled together, who had been members of the old organization,

  <questionnumber>644</questionnumber>
  <question>As members of the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>645</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I am talking of a time prior to the organization in 1852, and after what you call the dis-organization in 1844? You understand that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>646</questionnumber>
  <question>And I want to know if there was any bond of union between the different branches at the different places?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>647</questionnumber>
  <question>There was not?</question>
  <answer>Not that I know anything of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>648</questionnumber>
  <question>They all stood seperately, singly and alone?</question>
  <answer>Oh yes, - I have not much of an idea in relation to that, for all that I know is hearsay, as I was young then, and it has been so long ago that I may have forgotten some of the things in relation to that I heard then but it is my recollection now that they all stood by themselves during that period. They might and doubtless were, acquainted more or less, but no bond of union by virtue of which they met in conference existed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>649</questionnumber>
  <question>now you have testified as to your competency on these questions, and I will therefore enquire of you, how many branches existing at that time, - how many branches were existant at that time that is prior to a 1852?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know.</answer>

  <questionnumber>657</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know whether or not there was a William Smith branch at that time?</question>
  <answer>When William Smith came up there I do not think he had a branch attached to him, - I don't think he has what could be called an organization. I think that was a subsequent affair, but I had nothing to do with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>658</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if it was a "subsequent affair", tell what time it had its inception?</question>
  <answer>It was while he was there, and going to and fro from different places, for sometimes he was in Illinois, and sometimes at Waukeshaw, and sometimes at Beloit.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>659</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now I want to enquire if you can give me about the time of the inception of the branch over which he subsequently presided?</question>
  <answer>Well I couldn't do that, for I don't know anything about it.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the line of examination indicated by the foregoing question, and all the answers thereto, on the ground that it was irrelevant and immeterial and not cross-examination, and the witness is not competent to testify.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>660</questionnumber>
  <question>These are all the branches you can call to mind, - the one at Waukeshaw, the obe at Beloit, - these are all you can call to mind that existed at a time prior to 1852? Prior to the assembling of the conference in 1852?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for there was one at Blanchardsville, - I think that is the name of the place.</answer>

  <questionnumber>663</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was the head of that branch?</question>
  <answer>Well I think Gurley was probably its President, or Cyrus Newkirk. That is my recollection that it was either one of them but I don't know positively which was its head.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>664</questionnumber>
  <question>now there was another one was there not, somewhere, prior to 1858.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir there was several according to my understanding I have of it, but I don't know where they were, - there location is something I cannot tell you.</answer>

  <answer>I could not tell you that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>666</questionnumber>
  <question>About how many in the Beloit branch?</question>
  <answer>I could not tell you. I have given you a partial list of the names of the parties that belonged to it, but I couldn't tell you all who belonged to it, or even the number of members there was in it. Now since Saturday I have read over a list of names of the members of that branch, and I have prepared a list of names of the ones I personally know, - that is the ones I remember at this time, and I can read it over to you if desire me to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>667</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it is not necessary at this time. Now will you answer this question, - whether William Smith came to the Beloit branch at the time you speak of his coming there, - when he came there at that time, did he not come, and was he not received as his brothers successor?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>670</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>I was not there at the time he came here, and I never saw him there, and so I do not know of my own personal knowledge how he was received. What I said in relation to his being there is from what I know from the association, for I never met him until afterwards.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>671</questionnumber>
  <question>What was he doing there?</question>
  <answer>I can't say as to that either for I did not see him there at that time, but if you want what I heard about it, and I do not think there is the lease doubt but that is true, - he came there preaching the doctrine of lineage, the same as we are preaching now, and it culminated finally into an organization but just where it had its inception I could not say, but I think it was in Illinois. 672 (Written as 6723)</answer>
  <question>And afterwards I understood you to say that the church at that point, rejected him, or some of his doctrines?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. It rejected him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>673</questionnumber>
  <question>Rejected them in some way, - that is his doctrines or some of them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. He came there preaching the doctrine of lineage and that was not rejected, and some time afterwards he conceived the idea of re-organizing the church, and it resulted in effecting a partial organization, and some of the members there in Beloit became identified with that organization as such, and then soon afterwards some developments arose, and the result of these developments were that they withdrew from any fellowship with him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>674</questionnumber>
  <question>What were these developments if you know?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir, that he was temporarily the head of the church until the legal heir came forward. Now that was the position Mr Smith took, - that when the legal heir came forward and claimed his inheritance, and that was the son of his brother, he was to be recognized as the legal heir, and he was representing him until that time, and we recognized and accepted him as such.</answer>

  <answer>He made the claim of being President of the church.</answer>

  <question>And is it not a fact that the head of that church there at Beloit at that time, Jason W Briggs, recognized that claim?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>680</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>681</questionnumber>
  <question>Temporary, -?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that he was temporarily the head of the church until the legal heir came forward. Now that was the position Mr. Smith took, - that when the legal heir came forward and claimed his inheritance, and that was the some of his brother, he was to be recognized as the legal heir, and he was representing him until that time, and we recognized and accepted him as such.</answer>

  <question>Now as a matter of fact was not Jason W. Briggs one of William Smiths apostles in 1851?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is irrelevant and immeterial, and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I cannot say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>685</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say he was not?</question>
  <answer>He may have been, I think he was chosen as one. Well I don't say that either, for I think it was an high priest or something like that. I know he held an office of some kind.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>686</questionnumber>
  <question>You do remember that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>706</questionnumber>
  <question>Therefore he did not come from any branch?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not as a matter of necessity. Any one who belonged to the old organization had a right to sit in the conference as well as the delegates from branches.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>707</questionnumber>
  <question>And David Powell, - you say he was there also?</question>

  <questionnumber>716</questionnumber>
  <question>What was he in the conference of 1852?</question>
  <answer>I could not say. I couldn't say that he was more than a member of the branch there, but he may have been an elder, but if he was I am not apprised of the fact, still he may have been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>717</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know how he came to be in the conference?</question>
  <answer>He was a member of that branch.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>718</questionnumber>
  <question>Would that fact give him a membership in that conference?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>719</questionnumber>
  <question>Were all these members of that branch, members of that conference.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>720</questionnumber>
  <question>They were all members?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>721</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what so constituted them members of that conference?</question>
  <answer>By virtue of being members of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>722</questionnumber>
  <question>So then at that time, any member of the church, was entitled by vitue of that membership, to become a member of of that conference?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>723</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that a law of the church at that time?</question>

  <questionnumber>724</questionnumber>
  <question>It was a law of the church at that time?</question>

  <questionnumber>725</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what else did they have in the conference besides a voice?</question>
  <answer>Why he had a right to call the priveleges of the conference, - as a member of the church he had that privelege. Now I am not certain whether William Hartshorn held any office in the church at that time or not. I am not positive as to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>726</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is it a fact that the law prevailing at that conference as to membership, admitted any one to the priveleges of the conference? Is that a fact?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>727</questionnumber>
  <question>Any one who was or had been a member of the old church or any of its branches?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>728</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that the law of the re-organized church at the present time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>729</questionnumber>
  <question>It is the law of the re-organized church at the presne time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, with the exception that they have certain prevelege now that were not recognized then as delegates, in the sense in which they are appointed delegates, and then we did not have any such a regulation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>730</questionnumber>
  <question>You have stated then, that at that time all the members of the church were entitled to membership in the conferences, and were entitled to all its priveleges?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and there were some of them called ex-officio officers. They were not known then as we have them now, but I didn't know any of then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>731</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I understood you to say, and if I am not correct I would like for you to correct me, - that all the members of the church, were by virtue of their membership, entitled to a place in that conference held in 1852?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir they wee entitled to all its priveleges.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>732</questionnumber>

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>736</questionnumber>
  <question>They could all have attended?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, if they saw fit to do so, but it is not very likely that the whole membership of the church will ever desire to attend a conference at one time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>737</questionnumber>
  <question>That privelege inheres to every member of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, to some as officers, and to others as members of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>738</questionnumber>
  <question>And the whole twenty five thousand would have been entitled to all the priveleges?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>739</questionnumber>
  <question>And you state that to be the law of the church now?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>740</questionnumber>
  <question>Of or on what is a conference of the re-organized church, as held at the present time composed?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, not cross-examination and does not call for the best evidence of the fact south to be proven.</mono>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>741</questionnumber>
  <question>Of what is a conference of the Re-organized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints composed at the present time?</question>

  <questionnumber>744</questionnumber>
  <question>Are there any credentials required of parties who present themselves as members of the conference?</question>
  <answer>of delegates representing so many votes there is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>745</questionnumber>
  <question>As delegates they are required to present credentials?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir identifying them as the parties they purport to be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>746</questionnumber>
  <question>Now are not conferences based on delegates?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir and members. You would have noticed in this late conference held here if you had attended it, there was some things passed there and voted upon, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>747</questionnumber>
  <question>By every body who was present?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, all who were pleased to vote.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>748</questionnumber>
  <question>Well in forming a conference, is it not done by committees on organization?</question>
  <answer>Well some times that it is done, - generally I may say they have a committee.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>749</questionnumber>
  <question>Are not credentials brought in and submitted to the committee on organization?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to this whole line of examination on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, not cross examination, nor calling for the best evidence.</mono>
  <answer>When a vote is taken in the conference of the present reorganization church, a yea and nay vote is taken, and that is restricted to ex-officio officers and delegates.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>750</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the members of the church who are not ex-officio officers and delegates are not entitles to vote?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not on particular occasions.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>751</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is it not a fact that in such a case they would not be entitled to all the priveleges of the conference?</question>
  <answer>
    No sir.

  </answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness and to the answer of the witness on the ground and for the reason that</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>752</questionnumber>
  <question>But it is not a fact that that is the system that prevailed in 1852?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>753</questionnumber>
  <question>That is not the system that prevailed in the reorganization in 1852?</question>
  <answer>Well that was because the arrangement hadn't taken then, and those that constituted the conference at that time were the ones that assembled there, and things had not been systemized then as they have been done since, - and of course anything like that is merely a matter of detail and has nothing to do with the matter of doctrine or anything of that kind.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>754</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will get to that later one. Now in the organization of that conference of 1852, was there any committee on delegations?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not cross examination or the best evidence.</mono>
  <answer>I think not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>755</questionnumber>
  <question>Or on membership?</question>
  <answer>I could not say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>756</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am asking for your best impression if you have not positive knowledge?</question>
  <answer>I could not say, for I don't remember hearing any thing about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>757</questionnumber>
  <question>So then it is a fact that any body who came and claimed to hold a membership, - or I should say, who came and claimed to hold the faith of the church, was admitted to membership in the conference?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and of the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not cross-examination.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir, and it was the same then as it is now in that respect.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>758</questionnumber>
  <question>But I believe you stated that the difference between now and then was that now there are certain members that are permitted to vote on a yea and nay vote, and that then that distinction was not made?</question>
  <answer>What is that? How is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>759</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe that you stated that the difference between then and now is that at that time they were permitted to vote on all questions that came up, but not the lay members are not permitted to case a yea and nay vote on certain questions?</question>
  <answer>There was no such a thing known that we know anything of, - there was no such a thing known in that sense, for there is occasions now when they can all vote as well as then.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that it is irrelevant, incompetent and immeterial and not cross examination.</mono>

  <questionnumber>761</questionnumber>
  <question>At what point?</question>

  <question>To what organization did she belong, or was she a member of at the time she was admitted to that conference?</question>

  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>763</questionnumber>
  <question>How is that? I did not quite catch that?</question>
  <answer>I say I do not think she had united with what was called the reorganization at that time?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>764</questionnumber>
  <question>What branch did she belong to, if any?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question on the grounds and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>The branches there used to be the old organization, - the same as it had been all the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>765</questionnumber>
  <question>Did she belong o any branch at that time?</question>
  <answer>She had formerly been a member of that branch there at Beloit, but when the organization, I should say re-organization was effected the old branch became merged in the re-organization was effected the old branch became merged in the re-organization, and some of the members had not come into what was called the re-organization at the time that conference was held, - that is some of the members had not become identified with the re-organiza-at that time, and the proper branch under its direction.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>766</questionnumber>
  <question>So then you say she was admitted to that conference but did not belong to that branch?</question>
  <answer>I do not think she took any partor voice in that conference, - she held her self aloof, as she hadn't yet identified herself with it, - that is with the movement of re-organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>767</questionnumber>
  <question>She did not take any voice in it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I know she did not for that reason.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>768</questionnumber>
  <question>If that is the case why did you give her name as the name of one of the parties that was present and participated?</question>
  <answer>I did not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>769</questionnumber>
  <question>You didn't?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>770</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if you did not, what did you do?</question>
  <answer>I gave her name as one of the members of the old original church who was present, - there was nothing said about participation I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>771</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I beg your pardon, for if that is what you said I certainly mis-understood you?</question>
  <answer>The question was as to how many that belonged to the old organization was there, and I gave my mothers name as one, for she was formerly a member of the old organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>772</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you gave the names of eleven that I thought you said were members of the new organization as well as the old. Now there was John Williams, - where did he belong?</question>
  <answer>Well he was one of the members of the old organization who continued with and belonged to and was identified with this new re-organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>773</questionnumber>
  <question>What branch did he belong to?</question>
  <answer>That branch there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>774</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what one was that?</question>
  <answer>The branch there at Beloit. My impression is that it was called the Newark branch, but it was there in the town at Beloit.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>775</questionnumber>
  <question>Why was it called the Newark branch if it was in Beloit?</question>
  <answer>Well Newark was the name of the township.</answer>

  <question>Now what did Henry Pease belong to?</question>

  <questionnumber>777</questionnumber>
  <question>There at Beloit?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>778</questionnumber>
  <question>Was Eliza Briggs also a member of that branch?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to all the foregoing questions on the line of enquiry indicated to the last question, and moves the court to strike both from the record on the ground that they are irrelevant and immeterial and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think she was.</answer>

    </pagenumber>call for them. Now when I called for the names of the ones who were members of the old church, and who took part in that conference at Beloit, out of this list of two hundred names you say you have you could only give me eleven names of persons that were present?

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <answer>Yes sir. And here they are. There is one hundred and eighty of them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>838</questionnumber>

  <answer>No sir, to be exact there was or is one hundred and eighty names.</answer>

  <question>Then you do not undertake to say that these one hundred and eighty names you speak of now were all members of the conference of 1852?</question>
  <answer>No sir, they were not.

  <answer>Yes sir, I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>846</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that is the publication. I have one at home also. The copy of the publication referred to is marked Exhibit 10, J.M.Orr offered in evidence, and objected to an behalf of the plaintiff on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeteral, and not cross examination.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>847</questionnumber>
  <question>I will offer it now and have it marked for the purpose of identification only. Now will you take this pamphlet entitled. "A Word of Consolation to the Scattered Saints", and on page twenty one read fourteen lines, commencing at the top of the page.</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question on the ground that it is incompetent and irrelevant and not cross examination, and on the further ground that the portion designated to be read is a disconnected portion by transposition of a paragraph, and plaintiff insists that if any thing is read the whole paragraph shall be read.</mono>

  <answer>Witness reads from the paragraph referred to, beginning at the words, "we cannot forego", as follows, - "We cannot forego this opportunity to raise our voice against an evil which has well ning completed the over-throw of the church; - which Samson like hath lain hold upon the very pillars of society. And instead of order it has produced anarchy, instead of union, division; in short, instead of confidence and love, distrust and hatred. We refer to the system of spiritual wife-ry, taught by Brigham Young, to the "Plurality" doctrines of James J. Strang and the fouler system ( of (whoredom) taught by William Smith, and his joint occupant called "Spokesman". These systems, though unlike each other, are all known as a system of polygamy; under which they themselves take shelter; hence we will not treat of them under their proper names, but under the less offensive or semi-legal one, viz, polygamy".</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>848</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recognize that as a part of any of the documents authorized by that conference?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>849</questionnumber>
  <question>Of what is it a part?</question>
  <answer>That was done by the committee that was appointed to write that, and they wrote it, and it was presented to the next conference, and received.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>850</questionnumber>
  <question>And was it approved?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>851</questionnumber>
  <question>In what manner was it approved?</question>
  <answer>It was approved as the work of that committee. That part there is the last two pages of the document itself as printed.</answer>

  <question>Is there any difference between the document as printed and the original?</question>
  <answer>Not that I am aware of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>853</questionnumber>
  <question>You may examine it and see?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it was. After the committee had finished there was a resolution, - well, I don't know these facts of my own knowledge for I was not there at the time, - but the resolution it appears was introduced. I don't know how that came about, but these three pages were added, as it was not deemed to have declared expressely enough on that subject.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>854</questionnumber>
  <question>Added upon what authority?</question>
  <answer>I wouldn't say upon what authority. There is the words of the committee, and this was added to the words of the committee, and I see this was added to the work of the committee, but I would not say upon what authority, but I know it was declared on the intimation of the Spirit, for it was claimed it was not express enough as it came from the committee, and they were commanded to write three more pages, or what is written there that amounts to these three pages.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>855</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that piblished in pursuance of that resolution?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir there was a resolution passed upon an intimation that they should make the matter of plurality of wives apart of the announcement.</answer>

  <question>What you have read here was a part of what was intended or was written on the question of plural marriage?</question>

  <answer>"It was moved, that the report of the Presidency on the matter referred to them by this conference, from the Decatur District be received, and adopted as expressing the view of this conference." Saints Herald, vol26, pp 329, 330. This was adopted. In February the re-organized church published a tract for general distribution embodying the facts of the conference, held at Beloit, Wisconsin, June 12th and 13th, 1852., including an article against polygamy, from which we quote the following,-"We cannot forego this opportunity to raise our voice against an evil which has well nigh completed the over-throw of the church, which Sampson like, hath lain hold upon the very pillars of society; division; in short instead of confidence and love, distrust and hatred. We refer to the system of spiritual wife-ry taught by Brigham Young, and the plurality doctrines taught by James J. Strang. These systems though unlike each other, are all known as a system of polygamy under which they themselves take shelter; hence we will not treat of them under their proper names, but under the less offensive, or semi-legal one, viz., polygamy. Whence came the pratice and where is the warrant for it? The first we hear of it is from the lips of Lamech a son of Cain, who owns himself deserving of seventy fold greater punishment that Cain himself. We conclude therefore that none will quote Lamech in justifying precedent. But we insist that the father of the system give it its character. His shedding blood was but a type of what belongs to, or must accompany the system, since male and female come into the world about equal; and God having stamped upon man his own view, that "it is not good that man should be alone", hence, of course if one like Lamech secures one or two additional wives, he must either persuade that number of men that it is "good to be alone", or he must kill them off. It seems he chose the latter, which no doubt was the easiest"</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness and the answer of the witness thereto, and moves the court to strike the same from the record for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper cross-examination, and the witness cannot testify to facts of which he says he has no personal knowledge. And further objection is made on the ground that the pamphlet marked exhibit "M", from which the witness was asked to read, has never been introduced in evidence by either party in this case, nor offered by either party to this action as a part of the evidence in the case.</mono>

  <question>If it was a conference, the conference itself recognized them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I will illustrate that if you please. You do not seem to understand my meaning, and perhaps I can make you do so by an illustration. Last June a gentlemen came to a conference at Mission, Illinois. It was to a district conference he came, and he had in his possession a license of eldership in the church in 1841. I think it was, and we took his evidence, - it took that as evidence together with his statements tot he same effect, that he had been a member of the church then, and was at that time, and so we accepted him as a member on his old membership.</answer>

    </pagenumber>just how it was, but that is my impression.

  <question>The original church was rejected, - is that what you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>909</questionnumber>
  <question>Why do you say it was rejected?</question>
  <answer>Because it was rejected.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>910</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know that, - what evidence have you that that was the fact?</question>
  <answer>The evidence of its rejection was the taking away of its two principle officers, - the twp presiding officers of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>911</questionnumber>
  <question>At what time do you locate that rejection?</question>
  <answer>The evidence is that it was on the 27th day of June 1844, and I think that was the time.</answer>

  <answer>The revelations states that also.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>917</questionnumber>
  <question>But do you know it from any other means than your judgement of what the revelation means?</question>
  <answer>They set to work to accomplish that, and I know they did not accomplish it, and that that followed was an exhibition of their rejection.</answer>

  <answer>In what respect?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>919</questionnumber>
  <question>As to when the rejection should take place?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is not cross examination, is incompetent and immeterial, and not relevant to any issue in this case, and does not call for the best evidence.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir, it did.</answer>

  <question>What was the time?</question>
  <answer>A sufficient time, and that if they would do this they would be placed, and would not be moved out of their place.</answer>

  <answer>From history</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>927</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is it from that revelation and your understanding of it, that you say the church was rejected at this particular time in 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>928</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I would like to know more definitely the reasons you have for arriving at this conclusion?</question>
  <answer>The evidence we base it,-that is that we base the rejection on,-is this,-two of the principle officers were taken from the church, and then all the quorums broke up or were dissolved.</answer>

  <answer>
    At the time of the public reports of the assassination of Joseph and Hyrum Smith at Carthage, Illinois, the Spirit of God rested upon me, in power, and I say a vision, and in that vision I saw a statue,- a marble statue,-and I inquired as a soliloquy in my own mind "what does that mean"? and a person stood to my right, and I didn't noticed him, or heard him speak before,-and answered my question saying,-'you are compared to that statue". I noticed the person but did not take cognizance so as to state how he looked,-that is so as to be able to give his description. Immediately afterwards I saw a beautiful hand, transparent in appearance, and between the thumb and index finger was a sheet of paper, with the lower leaf open down so I could see both

    </pagenumber>sides of the paper, and when I looked upon it, I soliquized in my own mind again "what could that mean", and this personage to my right said "you are compared to that sheet of paper", and I then heard a voice out of it, serene, placid, and clear, and to my mind a sensation pervaded my mind, in a calm clear way, and a voice said, - "Joseph, the son of Joseph is the President of the church", and then followed the voice of the Spirit to me saying that his Father was dead, and the little child would be the successor of his father. I felt that Spirit in power, an I head that excellant voice from the heavens addressing me personally, and I say these manifastations with my eyes in truth. In the words of truth and seriousness I declare I heard and seen and felt these sensations".

  <questionnumber>941</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that all?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>942</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that all the truth of what you saw on that occasion you desire to say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is all. That is all there is to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>943</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there anything in all you have related to prove that the church was rejected?</question>
  <answer>It proved that the Presidence of the church had been taken from the church, and his successor would be his son.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>944</questionnumber>
  <question>Pardon me if I ask you to repeat that answer for I did not get that last?</question>
  <answer>It proved that the Presidence of the church had been taken from the church, and his son would be his successor. That is what I said.</answer>

  <question>Did it prove anything about the rejection of the church by the Almighty?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>946</questionnumber>
  <question>Did it prove anything about the rejection of the church by the Almighty?</question>
  <answer>It proved this to my mind that they were left without a revelator, a prophet and a seer, - a man like Moses holding all the gifts of God that were bestowed on the head of the church and that left the church without its complete organization. It proved it conclusively to me, hence the dis-organization of the church commenced immediately upon the taking away of Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>947</questionnumber>
  <question>Is this then, what you wish to be understood as saying, - the facts which you have related, showing that the head of the church has been taken away?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>948</questionnumber>
  <question>And the fact that the head of the church was dead, was sufficient to cause the rejection of the church, until the true successor should be installed in his place?</question>
  <answer>It proved to my mind then that the leading quorums, - the majority was taken from them, and that they were bereft without a general officer, as a revelator, seer or law giver to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>949</questionnumber>
  <question>And how long did that condition last? How long was it to last?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it calls for a conclusion of the witness, is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and is not cross examination.</mono>

Kelley, - "Let the record show that all this line of examination if objected to, and every question, and each and every answer is moved to be stricken from the record as immeterial, irrelevant and incompetent and not cross examination."

  <question>Now do I understand you correctly, when I understand you to say that the re-organization of the church has not been completed up to the present time?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question for the reasons above given.</mono>
  <answer>If I understand you to say or mean that the offices in the church have been filled that were filled in 1841 or 1844, I say they have not been filled yet. Not all of them. The reve- lation of 1841 was acted upon, by which the officers to which thic communication was addressed was recognized by God, and these officers have not yet all be re-placed in the re-or- ganization.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrel -evant and immeterial, and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Well now I think it expired long ago, but that is my opinion</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>955</questionnumber>
  <question>When did it expire?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question for the reasons a- bove set forth.</mono>
  <answer>Well I don't know when it expired. I know when the re-organ -zation began in its proper sense in the quoroms. I under- stand also I think, the sense in which it was rejected by com- mand of God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>956</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know that the revelation of which you speak, detailing to you the matters which you have related, was a revelation from God, otherwise than from your own judgement?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question on the grounds above set forth.</mono>
  <answer>My judgement as a matter of course is exercised in the mat- ter, and the evidence which I have, and my conclusion is based upon the experience and knowledge which we have of God's manner of dealing, as detailed in his word.</answer>

  <question>Now what is the fact about the persons that were there attending that conference, representing others who were not there, - that is representing these societies or branches that were not there?</question>

  <answer>I am. I had a brother laboring in a district or conference. I don't know how it was, for I don't know much about whether they were called districts then or conferences, –I don't know especially how that was, —but I think it was interchangeable, for they are the same as I understand it.

I never read that through in my life and I do not know all that is in that book (referring to exhibit four) So far as the specific details are concerned, I do not know them, but of course I understand the general details very well. I have been President of Districts and Missions for years and years, over thirty years sir have I myself occupied these positions, and I know what I am talking about I think.</answer>

  <answer>No sir, for very many times we go and hear other denominations preach just what we believe ourselves.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1137</questionnumber>
  <question>I understood you to say, but I may be wrong about it, and if I am now is a good time to correct the error?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I agree with you.</answer>

  <question>That no one could believe in the Bible and not believe the Book of Mormon and the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial.</mono>
  <answer>I do not think I made that statement.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1139</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not make that statement?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I think not. I have no recollection of making a statement like that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1140</questionnumber>
  <question>And did you not say that because the Book of Mormon, and the book of Doctrine and Covenants were books in perfect accordance with each other and with the Bible, and confirmed the Bible. Do you not say that in substance?</question>
  <answer>I said that they were in harmony, and the conclusion you speak of was a sequence that followed that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1141</questionnumber>
  <question>They were a sequence to that, to the Bible?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1142</questionnumber>
  <question>And a belief in the Bible did you not say, involved a belief in these other books?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that would follow as a natural consequence, a natural sequence of development.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1143</questionnumber>
  <question>And that the man couldn't be then a true, christian believer unless he believed in these sequences as you have stated them?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not say that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1144</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is not your testimony?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and it is not my belief either.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1145</questionnumber>
  <question>That is not your belief?</question>
  <answer>No sir, nor the belief of the church I represent. The church neither believes or teaches such a thing as that, and my ideas on that question are in harmony with the teachings of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1146</questionnumber>
  <question>Then is it the belief of the church you represent that all it is essential to believe is the Bible?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1147</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe you stated it was enough for fellowship in the church which you represent?</question>
  <answer>To believe in the Doctrine of Christ as taught in the Bible was enough, I believe I said. If I did not say that, that is what I meant to say, and I say it now.</answer>

  <question>This was published afterwards?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir after the first part was presented to the church and it was accepted, these that had it in hand became satisfied that it was not explicit enough upon that one sunbject and they, and they decided that three pages more should be written bye the committee and there they are. It was entrusted to this committee, - I know that much, but how the actual work was done I do not know how that was done, but it was permitted to be done or it would not be there I suppose.</answer>

  <question>By virtue of a revelation received by them, did you not say that?</question>
  <answer>Perhaps they did. I cannot say as to that, - at any rate they were moved upon and came to the conclusion to write it, but how it was done, or how they arrived at the conclusion to write it is something I cannot tell you for I do not know. It was reasoned over, and finally it was concluded that there should be three pages more written.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff moves the court to exclude from the record the answer of the witness to the last preceeding question for the reasons urged against the question to which they were answers, and on the additional ground that they are hearsay.</mono>

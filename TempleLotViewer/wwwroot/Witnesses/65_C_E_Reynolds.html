  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness and the answer of the witness there to on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent irrelevant and immaterial, and not rebuttal evidence and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>93</questionnumber>
  <question>I can't see that it calls for an opinion of the witness,-it calls for the plain, bare bald fact. Now the witness Hill in his testimony given in this case for the defendants, testified that there was no effort made, nor any proposition made or adopted or considered by the church, of which he was a member, looking towards the dressing of the members in the same same dress,-that is dressing the men all alike and women all alike. Now what do you know about that?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern,-"Now just wait a moment on that,-that is objectionable for the same reasons that the other questions were objected to, and it is objectionable on another ground,-that is a statement of what the witness Hill testified to is made in the question asked by the attorney for the plaintiff which is able for the witness Hill was his own witness on that proposition when he was on the stand, and no one can be permitted to impeach his testimony or his own witness, and for these reasons the question asked the witness is objected to." By Mr. Kelly,-"Let the record show that the plaintiff denies that they are disputing their own witness, and are not attempting to do so, and do not propose to attempt any such a practice, and deny also that the witness hill was their witness on that or any other proposition regarding which he testified, but on the contrary affirm that he was the witness of the defendants, and was put on the witness stand as the witness of the defendants, and that his examination by the plaintiff was only legitimate cross examination, and that the witness Hill testified substantially as detailed in the question asked this witness to which counsel for the defendants objects." By Mr. Southern,-"Let the record show that the statement of the attorney for the plaintiff is wholly improper in this case." By Mr. Kelley,</mono>

  <question>The witness Hill when giving his testimony on behalf of the defendants, testified substantially that there was no effort made, not any proposition made or adopted or considered by the church, of which he was a member and is now a member, looking towards the dressing of the members of that church in the same dress,-that is the women dressed in the one uniform pattern of dress, and the men all being clothed in an uniform pattern of dress as regards color, quality and texture?</question>

We have been trying to get a correct understanding of the law, and the time is not very far distant when the work of this church will be either approved by God pouring out his Spirit in power upon us, and giving un an endowment of the Holy Ghost, and give us power and authority to set these things in order, or we will moved out of the way "evidently the word "be" has been left out for it should read to make sense "we will be moved out of the way" but it reads "we will moved out of the way" and it goes on "as unprofita-servants.

    <question>I now offer in evidence from exhibit "200" commencing at the word "we" in the fifth line from the bottom of the page one, and leave it with the reporter, - all of the letter I leave with the reporter to copy into the record? Counsel for the defendants objects to the offer of proof for the reasons above set forth. The letter marked exhibit "200" above offered in evidence is in words and figured as follows, - Independence. 3-30-91. C.E. Reynolds and Wife. Dear Brother and Sister, Your letter received and read to the brethren. You will find the word amen used often in the middle of a revelation. That does not of necessity end a revelation, as it is often used at the end of a paragraph or subject. I have a book of commandments and find there are some changes, but as I said before in writing about the Evening and Morning Star the changes are all in our favor. We are aware that mistakes have been made, and we may be even now mistaken in some things, but we are trying to correct every mistake as fast as we find them out. We are satisfied with Granville made a mistake in advocating an organization on the basis of the revelation given to the 12 on priesthood. That revelation was not given until 1835, but it was in the first edition of the D. & C., and this was not dated when it was given, and the church has made the mistake for years in thinking that it was given before 1834, or before Joseph fell.

    <question>We now offer exhibit "202" commencing on page one at the top, down to and including the word "Utah" on page four of said exhibit and ask that the reporter copy same in the transcript?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
    <mono>By Mr Southern, - "That is objected to for the reasons given and applied to the other so-called exhibits offered and read in evidence" Exhibit "202" offered in evidence is in words and figures as follows, to wit, - Independence, 8-11-90. Dear Brother and Sister Reynolds, - I received your let- ter tonight, and will try and explain if I can, how the matter stands, - First, I want to ask you to be very careful and not let any of the Josephites read any of my letters to you, for if you are not aware of it, some of us know by experience, that the Josephites are the worst enemies we have got, and have tried their best to run us down, and get what little we have got, and if you will read the truth Teller, you will see how they misrepresented and done all they could to stop the work; on the other hand the Utah people have sent us money to help pay the taxes, and never tried in any way to injure us, and it was prophesied years ago that we would get our strength from the people of Utah, and I believe the time is not far off when we can if we will, receive the strength we need to enable us to publish to the world our position and expose false doc- trines. You have written several times that we ought to make an effort to do this, and we feel just as you did that these false doctrines must e exposed and the truth advo- cated, but how was it to be done. We have had our hands full to pay the taxes; only a few have done anything to help, and we will be forced to mortgage the temple lot to those who are our enemies, if we have to make any improve- ments which will have to be made before another year. This was revealed to me at the time the revelation was given when I met you, but I would not tell anyone about it. I wanted the Lord to reveal it through some one else and I thought I would work hard and encourage the others to work, and we would raise money in that way to do the printing, but the Lord sent an affliction upon me. I never suffered so in my life, and as I was praying and asking the Lord why I had to suffer so and why I could not get relief, it was made known to me that I had done like Jonah and that I must repent and make known to the church what had been revealed to me, and I promised the Lord that I would do my duty, and I began to get well. I have now re- covered so I am as well as ever. I made the matter known to the church and we all made it a matter of fasting and prayer, and the Lord gave us a strong testimony through one who had declared that they would never vote in favor of borrowing money on the temple lots, that it was of the Lord: and now Bro. and Sr. Reynolds, the Lord has given us instructions by his Spirit to use his property to carry on his work, and the way for all the saints to do is to make it a subject of fasting and prayer, that the Lord will direct you in the right in this matter. I do not want to influence you, I want the Lord to direct us individually and collectively, and then I know all will be well. We would not think of taking this step in our wisdom (???). Nowhing but the direction of the Spirit of God would get me to consent to take this step, but we all feel that the Lord has a right to do as he thinks best with this proper- ty. There is one thing more, - if we get the money where we expect to, it will be to their interest to defend the pro- perty, and it will have to be defended one of these days, and it will take money and a lot of it. We think we can see the wisdom of God manifest in this matter (???) for it will be the means of preserving the property and also of getting our position before the people in Utah."</mono>

The part of exhibit "203" offered in evidence is in words and figures as follows, - "The printing of the book of Mormon, continuing of the Morning and Evening Star is the work referred to. This must not go to any of the Josephites, as the Lord has kept these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them unto babes. The book of Mormon is to be printed in a cheap edition so as to be sold for fifteen or twenty cents a piece, so that every one can afford to buy one, and if we continue the paper that was printed here in 1832 and 1833, under the same name, we will have more grounds to claim we are the original church ordained on the 6th of April 1830. The word of the committee (???) will of necessity have to consider the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and I am satisfied we cannot accept all of the first edition. We must be consistent, an I think before we get through that all will see that it was very necessary for such a work to be done as is contemplated by the council."</question>

We are aware that mistakes have been made, and we may be even ow mistaken in some things, but we are trying to correct every mistake as fast as we find them cut.

That revelation was not given until 1835, but it was in the first edition of the D. & C. and there was not date when it was given, and the church has made the mistake for years in thinking it was given before 1834 or before Joseph fell. I examined the history some time ago, and found just when it was given and told the brethren, but some did not like to give it up, even when they knew it was given after Joseph fell, but most of use have laid it aside as unreliable and are not going to build on that or any revelation that was given after Joseph fell, and in consequence of some of the revelations being changed that were given before Feb. 24th 1834, we have to be very careful how we receive them. We have been trying to get a correct understanding of the law, and the time is not far distance when the work of this church will be approved by God pouring out his Spirit in power upon us, and giving us an endowment of the Holy Ghost, and give us power and authority to set these things in order, or we will moved out of the way as unprofitable servants. To whom much is given much is required, and we must do something instead of talking so much, if we are going to come out form under condemnation. We are not going ahead yet. We are trying to regain the ground lost in the early days of the church, and when we get back to the law and order given in 1830 and '31 then we may expect to start on towards perfection. We are glad that the same spitit is efforts. We are warned that the evil one will try to cause division and contention in our coming conference. Pray that truth and right may triumph over error and wrong doing, and we will remember you. Your Bro. C.A. Hall, - Independence, 3-16-91 C.E.

      </pagenumber>well, and interested in the work that we are all engaged in. Sr. Hill is quite sick not. I got my eye hurt in the shop and have not been able to work since the 28th of Dec. but I am about well now. The rest of the saints are well as far as I know. Geo. Hunter has withdrawn from the church. Bro. Frisby and Hill have been depending on me to write and so have neglected to write to you, but they have not forgotten you or lost their interest in your welfare. The mission work is progressing very favorably, 3 have been baptized and quite a number are near the kingdom. The brethren report they feel well, and the Lord is blessing them in their efforts, and they do not want for any thing needful. Bro. Cole will come back about the first of April. The rest will continue in the work. Some of the Indians expect to attend the conference on the 6th of April. In regard to the revelations in the book of covenants, we are aware there are many (?) things that are not correct. I have had the privilege of comparing the revelations in the D.&amp;C. with those published in the Evening and Morning star printed in Independence in 1832 & 1833 and find some very important changed have been made, but the changes are all in our favor. I have the corrections, and when we get able to have our own church books we will print the revelations as they are in the Evening and Morning Star. I do not think we are trying to practice or teach anything contrary to the book of Mormon. The question we are talking about now is pride and dress plain. We have almost concluded to come to an equality in dress; that is all the men and boys will have their clothes made of the same kind of cloth and in the same style, and all the women and girls have their dresses made out of the same kind of cloth and in the same style and be very plain. We have concluded from a careful examination of the word of God and by much fasting and prayer that unity cannot obtain unless we will cast aside all pride and become equal in dress to start with and in all other things as soon as the Lord will open up the way. Let us know what you think of this. May the Lord bless and prosper you is my prayer. Your brother in Christ. C.A. Hall." Exhibit "202" is in words and figures as follows, - Independence. 8-11-90. Dear Bro. & Sr. Reynolds, - I received your letter tonoght and will try and explain if I can, how the matter stands. First, I want to ask you to be very careful and not let any of the Josephites read any of my letters to you, for if you are not aware of it, some of us knw by experience that the Josephites are the worst enemies we have got, and have tried their best to run us down and get what little we have got. If you will read the Truth Teller you will see how they misrepresented and done all they could to stop the work. On the other hand the Utah people have sent us money to help pay the taxes, and never tried to injure us, and it was prophesied years ago that we would get our strength from the people of Utah, and I believe that time is not far off when we can, if we will, receive the strength that we need to enable us to publish to the world our position and expose false doctrines. You have written several times that we ought to make an effort to do this and we felt just as you did, that these false doctrines must be exposed and the truth advocated; but how was it to be done. We have had our hands full to pay the taxes. Only a few have done anything to held, and we will be forced to mortgage the temple lots to those who are our enemies, if we have to make any improvements, which will have to be made before another year. This was revealed to me at the time the revelation was given which I sent you, but I would not tell anyone about it. I wanted the Lord to reveal it through some one else, and I thought I would work 131 hard and encourage the others to work, and we would raise money in that way to do the printing, but the Lord sent an affliction on me. I never suffered so in my life, and as I was praying and asking the Lord why I had to suffer so, and why I could not get relief, it was made known to me that I had done like Jonah, and that I must repent and make known to the church what had been revealed to me, and I promised the Lord I would do my duty, and I began to get well, and have now recovered so I am as well as ever. I made the matter known to the church, and we all made it a subject of fasting and prayer, and the Lord gave a strong testimony through one who and declared that they would never vote in favor of borrowing money on the temple lots that it was of the Lord, and now Bro. and Sr. Reynolds, the Lord has given us direction by his Spirit to use his property to carry on his work; and the way for all the saints to do is to make it a subject of fasting and prayer, and that the Lord will direct you in the right in this matter. I do not want to influence you. I want the Lord to direct us individually and collectively, and then I know all will be well. We would not think of taking this step in our wisdom (?). Nothing but the direction of the Spirit of God would get me to consent to taking this step but we all feel that the Lord has a right to do as he things best with his property. Three is one thing more, - if we get the money where we expect to, it will be to their interest to defend the property, and it will have to be defended one of these days, and it will take money and a lot of it. We think we can see the wisdom of God manifest in this move (?) for it will be the means of preserving that property, and also of getting our position before the people in Utah, and many of the, will come out of the evil practices and return to Zion with songs of everlasting joy. I have received all your letters I think and thought I answered all your questions. Your last letter I cannot find so you will have to send me the questions again, and I will try and ask them. I have been very busy, - has to write to quite a number, and may have overlooked many things, but will try and be more careful in the future. Most of the saints are well. Sr. Annie Young is very sick now, and some think she will lost her mind. We have a special conference next Saturday at 2 P.M. to act on this matter. We are moving very careful in this matter. May the Lord help you to see aright and strengthen you in every good work is the prayer of your brother. C.A. Hall Exhibit "203" is in words and figures as follows. to wit, (On the margin of exhibit "202", - page 4, - appears the following, - "As soon as you are satisfied send us your vote for or against what is proposed.") Exhibit "203" Independence. 6-19-90. C.E. Reynolds and Wife,. - Dear Bro. and S., - As I have a little time I thought I would write a few lines and answer some of your questions. We have had some troudle in executing the law, but everything is working out all right. George and Melissa have their case settled. The printing of the book of Mormon and continuing of the Mourning and Evening Star is the work referred to. This must not go to any of the Josephites, as the Lord has kept these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to babes. The book of Mormon is to be printed in a cheap edition, so as to be sold for 15 or 20 cents a piece, so that every one can afford to buy one, and if we continue the paper that was printed here in 1832 and 1833 under the same name, we will have more grounds to claim we are the original church ordained on the 6th of April 1830. The work of the commit- 132 tee will of necessity have to consider the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and I am satisfied I cannot accept all of the first edition. We must be consistent, and I think before we get through that all will see that it was very necessary for such a work to be done as is contemplated by the committee. The saints are most all well. I have been sick for a day or two from over-work, but think I will be able to go to work tomorrow again. Well this is all of importance I can think of now. Hoping and praying that we will all be led by the spirit of truth, I remain as ever, your brother. C.A. Hall.

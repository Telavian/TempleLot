  <questionnumber>178</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did you get that money?</question>
  <answer>From the church. Well there was a fund in my hands at the time belonging to the church I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>179</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did that money come from?</question>
  <answer>Well it came from different sources I think, mainly from contributions of members. It was contributed at different times, and in different amounts at various times to defray the expenses of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>180</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did the money come from with which you paid these tax receipts, usually or generally?</question>
  <answer>Well from contributions usually. At that time there was a fund in my hands that came from William Eaton that belonged to the church, and it was turned over to me as the agent of the church to pay these expenses with.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>181</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the amount of that fund, and how was it expended?</question>
  <answer>Well now I don't remember just exactly the amount, or how it was all applied, but it was applied in building sidewalks, and fencing and otherwise improving the lot there together with other money that was put into my hands for that purpose.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>182</questionnumber>
  <question>The money that you used for paying the taxes, what money was that?</question>
  <answer>It was the same money, the money that was appropriated for paying the taxes, was the same fund that was used for these other expenses. It was all used for paying the current general expenses of the church whatever they were, and this was one of the items of expenses that was to be paid out of the fund. I think perhaps that some of the first tax receipts that I paid were paid with my own money, but the church accounted to me for it afterwards.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>183</questionnumber>
  <question>You paid at first some of your own money, for which the church afterwards accounted to you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that I think was at the first. I just paid out my own money, and took receipts for it, and then when I would render my account to the church they would recompense me for it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>184</questionnumber>
  <question>You mean they would repay you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is what I mean.</answer>

  <answer>I don't know that it was ever organized as a faction. I rather incline to the to the opinion that it was not, for I know that I always understood it to be a perpetuation of the original church, as it was organized in 1830.

  <questionnumber>231</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will tell you what I am trying to get at Mr Owens. This is what I am trying to get at, Mr Owens. This is what I am trying to get at, - You recognize do you not that there was a disorganization of the church that was organized in 1830 along about 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I do now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>232</questionnumber>
  <question>You understand that there was a disorganization of that organization effected on the 6th day of April 1830 about 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes when you call my attention I do remember hearing that there was such a thing, and that the church split or was cut up into different factions, and adopted different doctrines in this and that regard. I head and have read that such was the fact.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "I object to all your questions on this line of examination on the ground that they are improper cross examination, and because the witness is not speaking of his won knowledge, and therefore the testimony is hearsay, and the witness has not shown himself to be qualified to speak as an expert on the history of the church, and because the questions are incompetent. By Mr Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>233</questionnumber>
  <question>I called your attention Mr Owens to that date simply to fix the date in your mind that is all?</question>
  <answer>Well I remember hearing that that is the fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>234</questionnumber>
  <question>Now with reference to the time of the disorganization, with reference to the time of the death of Joseph Smith, - when was it after the death of Joseph Smith that the faction of the church that is known as the "Hedrickite faction" was organized with officers of any kind?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, -</mono>

  <question>Just state what you know Mr Owens, and nothing else?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>236</questionnumber>
  <question>That is right. I don't want Mr Owens or any body else to state anything only what they know. That is all I want and all I expect from Mr Owens, and if I wanted anything else I think I have the wrong man on the witness stand to get it from?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know anything about that. I don't know that there was ever an organization such as you speak of effected at any time. Understand that at that time I was not a member of the church, for I joined it in 1864, but I was some what acquainted with the history of the church before that time from what I heard from people who were acquainted with the church before that time, - who had belonged to the church in other places.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>237</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not join the church proper to 1864?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but my father was a member of the church before that time, - he was a member of the church for years before I was born I suppose. Now I have been trying to get at the answer that I believed you wanted, and I will state further that in 1855 my father and Granville Hedrick and some other men that I have been acquainted with since began to associate themselves together in prayer meetings and in other ways, and they looked over these things, and offered among themselves to others whom they met, their objections to the way different men who claimed to be the head of the church, were trying to build up the cause.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>238</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was that the organization you referred to?</question>
  <answer>Well now can you call that an organization or what you please. I don't know what you would call that, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>239</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know anything prior to that time that ocurred, more definitely than that?</question>
  <answer>
    No sir I don't know of anything more definite

    </pagenumber>than that that occured prior to that, and I can't say that I know that absolutely of my own knowledge, but that is the way I understood the matter took form.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>240</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the first you know about it?</question>

  <answer>Well there was my father. I think he could perhaps be called one of the leading men in the church for he was an elder, and there was Hedrick, and there was Mr Charles Reynolds, and there was William Eaton, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>244</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that all you can mention?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I think not. I think I can name others. There was William Eaton, and let me see, - there was Haldeman, - A.C. Haldeman, and I think John T. Clarke here, and perhaps others. There was perhaps some others whom I have not mentioned for I cannot remember all of them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>245</questionnumber>

  <answer>I don't think, - Granville Hedrick, David Judy and Richard Hill were all of them at one time and another recognized as he Presiding authority. If I am not mistaken at various times they were all recognized as the presiding authority during the time that I was acting as agent.</answer>

  <answer>Yes sir, I think so, - either agent or clerk or both.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>294</questionnumber>
  <question>And your action as agent or clerk or both, has been on the understanding or theory held by Hedrick during his life time, and Judy and Richard Hill was that: it was the legal succession of the church that was organized in 1830?</question>
  <answer>I do not understand that question, - ?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>295</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if it is not a fact that your administration under these gentlemen whose names I have mentioned was not performed on the theory that you were acting or an organization which was the succession to the original church that was organized in 1830?</question>
  <answer>Well yes sir. It was designated to maintain that organization, - that is it was intended to maintain a working organization.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>296</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there a branch of the church organized in the neighbourhood of where you reside Mr Owens?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>297</questionnumber>
  <question>How many members are there there besides yourself?</question>
  <answer>In this branch do you mean?</answer>

  <question>No sir, - down in that neighbourhood where you live?</question>
  <answer>Do you mean how many members there is in all belonging to the church? I don't know as I understand your question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>299</questionnumber>
  <question>No, no, I mean how many of the members of the church to which you consider you belong, live in the neighbourhood where you live?</question>
  <answer>I don't know of any other, - not in my immediate neighbourhood.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>300</questionnumber>
  <question>Then if you do not belong to this branch here in Independence, you do not belong to any particular branch?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>301</questionnumber>
  <question>You are known as what is called a "scattered member".</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I expect so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>302</questionnumber>
  <question>That is a member not belonging to any branch?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Looking at it that way I have, but I have always considered myself, considered my church priveledges as belonging to the Independence branch. There has never been any odher branch organized here or in this vicinity to which I could belong.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>303</questionnumber>
  <question>Well in church meetings you would not have the right to vote the same as members would, would you?</question>

  <questionnumber>304</questionnumber>
  <question>You would not have the right to do that so far as local interests or matters are concerned?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I would not consider that I had if a strict construction was placed on the rule.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>305</questionnumber>
  <question>That would be because of the rule that has been established by the church here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>306</questionnumber>
  <question>You have not that right now?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <question>Mr Owens did any of the money that you paid out for any of these matters for this local branch of the church here, which you re presented, ever come from the re-organized church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?</question>
  <answer>Not that I know of. If any of it did I have no knowledge of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>310</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they ever offer to give you any money for any purpose here?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is leading, and incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial.</mono>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>311</questionnumber>
  <question>They never did?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not that I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>312</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever represent them in anything that you did here?</question>
  <answer>No sir?</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons above set forth, and on the ground that it calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>313</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is all?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Re cross examination by Mr Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>314</questionnumber>
  <question>Now in your direct examination you answered that a pat of this money was paid by William Eaton did you not?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendant objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is not re-examination.</mono>
  <answer>I do now know what you mean?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>315</questionnumber>
  <question>You answered that there was a fund raised, and that William Eaton contributed to - the fund did you not?</question>
  <answer>There was a fund I said that came into my hands from him, but the funds that came into my hands that way were funds that the church, - funds that belonged to the church that were in his hands, and it came into my hands from his estate.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>316</questionnumber>
  <question>Well William Eaton contributed to the fund that was raised for the paying of the expenses of the church did he not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I believe so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>317</questionnumber>
  <question>His wife was a member of the re-organized church of Jesus Christ, the plaintiff in this suit, at that time, wasn't she?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I think she was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>318</questionnumber>
  <question>And she contributed too, didn't she?</question>
  <answer>Never that I knew anything of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>319</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>321</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't some of these tax receipts show that the money was paid to you as trustee?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I think there is one in there that reads that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>322</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how do you explain that, - what do you say to that?</question>
  <answer>I think there is one in there that shows that, but that is a mistake of the clerk, for I went in and asked the clerk to make out a receipt for it and he made the mistake. I paid the taxes in connection with my other taxes, - I told him to bring the while thing in together, and he mentioned me in it as trustee.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>323</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any more than that?</question>
  <answer>There is only the one I think but as I say it is a mistake of the clerk who wrote it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>324</questionnumber>
  <question>I noticed here Mr Owens that in exhibit "126", and in exhibit "127", "128", "129" and "130", and one receipt that is not marked as an exhibit at all, being dated the 19th day of December 1885, all purport to be paid by you as trustee?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I believe that is so, but that is just a form they adopted in the collectors office, for I do not think I was ever made a trustee by any action of the church. If I ever was I have no recollection of it, and that is merely a form that they adopted in making out their receipts I was under the impression that there was only one of them, but I see there is more than one made out that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>325</questionnumber>
  <question>And also there is exhibit "131", paid in November 1887?</question>
  <answer>Well I do remember having mentioned that to him, but the collector sometimes. I remember mentioned that to the collector sometimes and telling him that that was not correct, but they said it did not make any different, that it was merely intended to show that I paid them for the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>326</questionnumber>
  <question>What is it they said?</question>
  <answer>They said that it merely showed that the taxes were paid by me as the one having charge of the matter of the payment of the taxes. They started in that way and I suppose they just kept it up that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>327</questionnumber>
  <question>Then these receipts that recite that the taxes were paid by you as trustee, - these receipts that I have called off to you by their numbers as exhibits, - that recite that the payments were made by you as trustee are not correct?</question>
  <answer>No sir not in that particular, and I never authorized any one to put them that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>328</questionnumber>
  <question>They are not correct in so far as the word "trustee" is concerned?</question>
  <answer>No sir. That is the way I understand it, that it is simply an error of the clerk who wrote out the receipts is concerned, - that is all there is to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>329</questionnumber>
  <question>You were not the trustee but you were the agent?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I was merely the agent or clerk of the church, and was charged with the duty of performing this work, and the receipts were made to show that I paid the money on behalf of the church, and not in my individual capacity. It was merely designated to show the relation I bore to the church, - not as the trustee, however, but as the agent or clerk.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>330</questionnumber>
  <question>Now when did Granville Hedrick die?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "That is objected to. I think that this examination is out of order, and the time has come for me to object to it if I am to object at all. I object to this line of examination because you have sked these questions before, or if you have not you state that your cross examination was closed, and I have examined the witness in re-direct and did not bring out anything of that kind, and therefore you are not entitled to examine in rebutial, therefore I object to this method of proceedure as irregular.</mono>

  <answer>I do not remember the date of his death.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>332</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if you do not remember the exact date give us about the time as near as you can when he died Mr. Owens?</question>
  <answer>Well I think it was in '81. I have no date to go by, but I think it was then, if I am not greatly mistaken.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>333</questionnumber>
  <question>It was after his death that any of these papers came into your hands, either as agent, clerk, trustee or otherwise?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that is not what I said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>334</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what do you say about it now?</question>
  <answer>Well I was the clerk, and had charge of some of these papers that I spoke of before his death, and I think that I even paid some of these taxes before his death. I think I paid the taxes at different time before his death.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>335</questionnumber>
  <question>I mean with reference to the papers that you received from Mrs Hedrick?</question>
  <answer>Well I refer to the deeds and the tax receipts that we had on the first purchase of the property there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>336</questionnumber>
  <question>What deeds do you refer to?</question>
  <answer>The deeds that John Hedrick got for that property, and the deeds that he executed to Granville Hedrick, and the deed that Granville Hedrick executed to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>337</questionnumber>
  <question>They were in the possession of Mrs Hedrick, the widow of Granville Hedrick?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>338</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is what she delivered to you at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir along with some tax receipts that had been paid for the property before that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>339</questionnumber>
  <question>They wee delivered to you after he died?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>340</questionnumber>
  <question>The deeds and certain of these tax receipts?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - the tax receipts that he and his brother John took up themselves.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>341</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it was after Granville Hedrick's death, that you got whatever papers you did get from Mrs Hedrick.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>342</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is all?</question>

  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>344</questionnumber>
  <question>What church was he a member of?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper re-direct examination.</mono>
  <answer>He was a member of the Church of Christ to which I belonged at the time, and still belong, as I understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>345</questionnumber>

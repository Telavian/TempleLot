  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question on the ground that it is leading, and incompetent, irrelevand and immaterial.</mono>
  <answer>Well, the circumstances were these, - it was a command from God to me to receive it, and I would rather have laid down my life than disobeyed it, but it was a grand and glorious principle that was to be established, and when I was called upon I stepped forward and gave myself up as a sacrifice to establish that principle, and I did that in the face of prejudice, of course. In this day and age of the world we are considered fanatics of course, more or less. I gave myself up as a sacrifice, for it was not a love matter, so to speak, in our affairs, - at least on my part it was not, - but simply the giving up of myself as a sacrifice to establish that grand and glorious principle that God had revealed to the world. Counsel foe the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness on the ground and for the reasons given in the objection to the question to which it is an answer and on the additional ground that it is not responsive to the question, and moves the court to strike it from the record for those reasons.</answer>

  <answer>Well we always considered it as the family, for my brother always lived there up to the time he was married, and was there for six months afterwards, and that is how I had the privilege of going and staying with them, for when they had a family I thought the caring for the smaller children that were there was too much for the young wife, and so I wanted to go with them and begged that privilege.</answer>

  <questionnumber>241</questionnumber>
  <question>Then neither yourself nor your sister, nor the Law- rence girls were employed there for any purpose?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>242</questionnumber>
  <question>You just lived there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that was our home and Joseph did not look upon us as servants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>243</questionnumber>
  <question>How did Emma his wife look upon you?</question>

  <questionnumber>245</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he hire you to go there, or did Emma hire you?</question>

  <answer>No sir, it was not there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>251</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not just say that it was in the mansion house that he taught you polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but I did not say that that was where he first taught it, for it was before that that he taught it to me. You see he did not move into the mansion house until the fall of 1843 and I was taught that by him before that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>252</questionnumber>
  <question>In the fall of 1843 in, -in what month was it that you moved into the mansion house?</question>

  <questionnumber>254</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>255</questionnumber>
  <question>It was called the prophet's home?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>256</questionnumber>
  <question>How big was that house?</question>
  <answer>Well it was quite big, or large enough to make all the family comfortable that was there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>257</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was that the hotel building?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but there was so many strangers coming there from distant quarters to Nauvoo, who would be seekers after the truth and such as that who wanted entertainment, that that was the reason that the mansion house was built so that there might be room for entertainment.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>258</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was the mansion house?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for that house was always full, and that was the reason the mansion house was built.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>259</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did all you females do that were there in that house?</question>
  <answer>We all did whatever there was for us to do.</answer>

  <questionnumber>263</questionnumber>
  <question>When your brother married Joseph Smith gave him some assistance?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, he helped him off in the world as well as he could, for the prophet was a very kind, thoughtful, big-hearted man.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>264</questionnumber>
  <question>When your brothers were living there did they work for the prophet?</question>
  <answer>Why certainly they did,-they were industrious boys and were never idle.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>265</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did they do?</question>
  <answer>Whatever there was to do.</answer>

  <question>Were you always busy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>268</questionnumber>
  <question>What were you doing?</question>
  <answer>Oh we were not idle, -we were always busy, almost, for there was enough around the house for us to do. We were not idlers. There were no idlers in Nauvoo at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>269</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what particular word did you do?</question>
  <answer>Well I did sewing mostly, but of course after we moved into the mansion house there was a great dealt to be done, fitting up and getting things in shape.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>270</questionnumber>
  <question>That (What) did the Partridge girls do?</question>

  <questionnumber>271</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you pretend to say that all the girls whom you have named were not there working for the prophet, and that you did not go out and work for wages on the outside?</question>

    </pagenumber>was our house, and there was not one of us that was working there or any other place for regular wages.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>272</questionnumber>
  <question>You want the record to show that you and all these other girls were there working for the prophet, and that it was the home of all of you?</question>
  <answer>Well now I don't remember how long the Lawrence girls stayed there. If I remember the Lawrence girls, well I could not tell you how long they were there, but their home was there when they was there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>273</questionnumber>
  <question>The Lawrence girls were married too, to the prophet, were they not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>280</questionnumber>
  <question>Yet you say of your own knowledge that you were married to him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>281</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know that if you were not present?</question>
  <answer>I was present when I was married to him I think, it is highly probable that I was there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>282</questionnumber>
  <question>I meant to ask you how it is that you could swear that the Lawrence girls were married to Joseph Smith when you were not present at the weddings, you are swearing remember to things within your own knowledge and I would like to know how that came to your knowledge if I did not see it?</question>

  <question>You mean Emma Smith, the wife of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, she knew they were married to him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>287</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I move to exclude that part of the answer as to what Emma Smith knew from the record on the ground that it is not responsive to the question. I did not ask you anything about what she knew. Just answer my questions simply, and we will get along much better. Now you were all married in 1842 to him?</question>
  <answer>I can't say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>288</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is your best recollection about that?</question>
  <answer>I can't say, for I haven't any recollection about it, as I was not there when they were married to him. I don't know anything about the time of their marriage beyond the fact that they were married, and I got that from Joseph and themselves, so I presume it was true.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>289</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you say you knew they were married?</question>

  <question>Do you decline to answer the question I ask you on the ground that your answers might tend to criminate you?</question>

  <questionnumber>341</questionnumber>
  <question>Your feelings were not so tender when in 1848 you married a man who at that time to your knowledge had four or five other women living with him as wives, according to your statement, - and imposed yourself upon his innocent wife, and deceived her, by joining in that kind of an alliance with her husband, - that was not insulting, but now when I ask you a question that I have a perfect right under the law to ask you you say it is insulting?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not in the light that we accepted it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>342</questionnumber>
  <question>And it is not insulting at this late date after the man whom you have maligned is dead and cannot be to deny or refute your story for you to come up and tell this tale, which if true would forever dishonor his memory, - there is nothing dishonorable or insulting in that, - there is nothing dishonorable or insulting in your attempting to palm yourself off as the wife of a man who is dead, and never for a moment in his life did anything to countenance your pretentions?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, he would speak if he was here, - he would speak in tones of thunder.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>343</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I would like to hear him speak it, for he was very careful never to do so in this life, - he was careful never to acknowledge you as his wife either in tones of thunder or any other kind of tones?</question>
  <answer>Well he would, - he taught that principle, and while you may scoff at us we yet believe the principle, and it is sacred with us.</answer>

  <question>Was Brigham Young a member of the Twelve then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think he was the President of the Twelve then as he was before. That is the way I think it was.</answer>

  <question>Well did you?</question>
  <answer>I did not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>515</questionnumber>

  <answer>Well I never asked him to find out.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>516</questionnumber>
  <question>How many did he have before his death, besides yourself?</question>
  <answer>I think you would have to go to the records for that.</answer>

  <questionnumber>526</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the way it was?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>527</questionnumber>
  <question>The principle was all you were working for?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for I knew it was a true principle.</answer>

  <questionnumber>532</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your belief?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and the day will come when you will doff your hats to the plural wife system, must as you may sneer at it now.</answer>

  <question>I beg your pardon, madam, for while I may have my opinion on that matter, i have not insinuated anyting of the kind, and have not any intention of doing so.</question>
  <answer>Well, I judge from the remarks you made to one of my friends that that was your opinon, that we lived a vile lie, and I feel so insulted that I cannot help speaking as I do, for we have lived pure lives and have made great sacrifices, and have tried to live purely and faithfully obey the laws of the church and the commandments of God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>563</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mrs. Kimball, I am just trying to find out what the system is, and that is the reason I ask you these questions, and it is not because I feel curious to peer into something that you may think has nothing to do with this case, but to serve my clients as well as I know how. You must remember that we are attempting to get this matter before the Judge of the United States Circuit Court so that he will understand what this system is. You see, I am a young man and I can be pardoned if I want to know something about those things. Now you say that Joseph Smith taught you polygamy in 1842?</question>
  <answer>Now don't go over all that again. I have told you the facts, and I don't wish to be tired out telling it all over again to you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>564</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, just answer my question, and it will be much better for you, and you will get away all the sooner, for I am resolved to get at the bottom of this thing, If possible, and I believe I shall. Now did you say that Joseph Smith taught you polygamy in 1842?</question>
  <answer>I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>565</questionnumber>
  <question>He taught you the principle of polygamy in 1842?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>

  <answer>I can't tell you the date, nor even the month, but it was in 1842.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>567</questionnumber>
  <question>He taught you that in the mansion house where you were living at the time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was at my old home.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>568</questionnumber>
  <question>The home where you lived with your mother?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was at the old home where he lived before the mansion house was built or finished.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>569</questionnumber>
  <question>He taught you that at the old home?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>570</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there anybody present when he taught you that?</question>
  <answer>Well now look here, that is my business, sir, and I do not propose to tell you that or to tell anybody else that. That is my business entirely and you have no right to pry into it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>571</questionnumber>
  <question>I have not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, you have not.</answer>

  <answer>I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>573</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, what did he say to you when he taught you the principle?</question>
  <answer>Well, that is my business. Suffice it to say that he taught me that principle as a sacred and holy principle that would endure forever.</answer>

  <question>Neither your sister nor the Lawrence girls married Heber C. Kimball?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>557</questionnumber>
  <question>Did the Partridge girls marry him?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Yes, I was mistaken in what I said for Sarah Lawrence did marry him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>558</questionnumber>
  <question>She married Heber also?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>559</questionnumber>
  <question>Did she marry him before you did, or after you did?</question>
  <answer>I don't know. I did not make an inquiries about that for it was nothing to me when she married him. That has nothing to do with me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>560</questionnumber>
  <question>That has nothing to do with you?</question>
  <answer>No sir. You need not say anything about it for the life we lived was an honorable one. We have not lived a vile life sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>561</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am not saying you did?</question>
  <answer>Well you insinuated it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>562</questionnumber>
  <question>I beg your pardon madam, for while I may have my opinion on that matter, I have not insinuated anything of the kind, and have not any intention of doing so?</question>
  <answer>Well I judge from the remarks you make to one of my friends that that was your opinion, that we lived a vile life, and I feel so insulted that I cannot help speaking as I do, for we have lived pure lives and have made great sacrifices, and have tried to live purely and faithfully obey the laws of the church and the commandments of God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>563</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mrs. Kimball I am just trying to find out what the system is, and that is the reason I ask you these questions, and it is not because I feel curious to peer into something that you may think has nothing to do with this case, but to serve my clients as well as I know how. You must remember that we are attempting to get this matter before the Judge of the United States Circuit Court so that he will understand what this system is. You see I am a young man and I can be pardoned if I want to know something about these things. Now you say that Joseph Smith taught you polygamy in 1842?</question>
  <answer>Now don't go over all that again. I have told you the facts, and I don't wish to be tired out telling it all over again to you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>564</questionnumber>
  <question>Well just answer my question, and it will be much better for you, and you will get away all the sooner, for I am resolved to get at the bottom of this thing, if possible, and I believe I shall. Now did you say that Joseph Smith taught you polygamy in 1842?</question>
  <answer>I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>565</questionnumber>
  <question>He taught you the principle of polygamy in 1842?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>566</questionnumber>
  <question>Now how early in 1842 was it that he taught you that?</question>
  <answer>I can't tell you the date, nor even the month, but it was in 1842.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>567</questionnumber>
  <question>He taught you that in the mansion house where you were living at the time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was at my old home.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>568</questionnumber>
  <question>The home where you lived with your mother?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was at the old home where he lived before the mansion house was built or finished.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>569</questionnumber>
  <question>He taught you that at the old home?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>570</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there any body present when he taught you that?</question>
  <answer>Well now look here, that is my business sir, and I do not propose to tell you that or to tell any body else that. That is my business entirely and you have no right to pry into it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>571</questionnumber>
  <question>I have not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, you have not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>572</questionnumber>
  <question>Therefore that is another question that you decline to answer?</question>
  <answer>I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>573</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did he say to you when he taught you that principle?</question>
  <answer>Well that is my business. Suffice it to say that he taught me that principle as a sacred and holy principle that would endure forever.</answer>

  <questionnumber>574</questionnumber>
  <question>And you believe that it will endure forever?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is my belief.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>575</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did he tell you?</question>
  <answer>That is my business.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>576</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he tell you that a man could have more wives then one?</question>
  <answer>Well he said that day was near.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>577</questionnumber>
  <question>That the day was neas when a man could have more wives than one?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. He said that the principle would be established and that the time was near when it would be established.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>578</questionnumber>
  <question>And he married you that day that he told you that?</question>
  <answer>no sir, I did not say so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>579</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how long afterward was it when he married you?</question>
  <answer>Well I have told you the day that he married me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>580</questionnumber>
  <question>I know that but you have not told me that day that he told you that, and I want to find out how long it was after he told you that before he married you.</question>
  <answer>Well I cannot tell you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>581</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did he say to you when he taught you polygamy?</question>
  <answer>I shan't say anything about it, for that is my business and not yours. 582 (Mistakenly listed as 682)</answer>
  <question>Well do you decline today to testify to anything only what you see fit to say?</question>
  <answer>I decline to tell you anything about that, for the reason that it is my business and not yours, and because you are asking these questions not for any useful purpose but simply for the purpose of worrying me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>583</questionnumber>
  <question>That is merely an assumption of yours madam?</question>
  <answer>Well I think the facts prove it. This is all sacred to me, and for that reason I decline to tell anything about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>584</questionnumber>
  <question>Who called you here?</question>
  <answer>President Woodruff told me that I was wanted here, and when I came here I supposed all you wanted to know was that Joseph Smith had more wives than one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>585</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is not what we are specially interested in, - what he taught you is what we want to know?</question>
  <answer>Well what he taught me is what I will not tell you. I testified that I was his wife, and that is the truth, and I know that I am to be eternally his wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>586</questionnumber>
  <question>And you know you did not have any children by him?</question>
  <answer>Well now that is something that I did not tell you anything about at all. It is none of your business if we had twenty sons or children, and it is none of your business if we did not have any.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>587</questionnumber>
  <question>What did you consider Joseph Smith to be?</question>
  <answer>I considered him to be a man of God sir, - a great, good and holy man of God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>588</questionnumber>
  <question>And yo consider the present Joseph Smith to be your son, by virtue of the fact that you married his father, don't you?</question>
  <answer>I do not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>589</questionnumber>
  <question>But you married his father?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>590</questionnumber>
  <question>They why do you not consider him to be your son?</question>
  <answer>If he will acknowledge me as his mother, and acknowledge his error and believe as I do, I shall be happy to consider him as my son.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>591</questionnumber>
  <question>Well he would not believe as you do? Would he?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and no cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I believe the day will cone when he will, for I sincerely loved those boys and nothing would please me better than to see them remedy the error of their way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>592</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he not tell you himself that you were not his mother?</question>
  <answer>He said his father had no more wives than his mother, and he knew at the time he said that, that he was telling a falsehood.</answer>

    </pagenumber>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness as well as the answer of witness thereto, on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not cross examination, and moves the court to strike out the answer for the same reasons.
  </mono>
  
  <questionnumber>593</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he not tell you that?</question>
  <answer>He did not, for we had no conversation on that subject.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>594</questionnumber>
  <question>Now how do you know he told a lie or falsehood, which is the same thing?</question>
  <answer>Because he knows better.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>595</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever hear him make a declaration to that effect that his father did not have more wives than one?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>596</questionnumber>
  <question>Where?</question>
  <answer>In his lectures.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>597</questionnumber>
  <question>Well where was that?</question>
  <answer>In his lectures at Logan he said the question is not whether my father had more wives than one, but the question is, is it right. Now did he not give himself away there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>598</questionnumber>
  <question>I don't think so?</question>
  <answer>Well I do.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness above, and the answers of the witness thereto for the reasons above set forth.</mono>
  <answer>I don't think so any way. I know he said that, - that is not hearsay, for I was there on the stand and spoke to him and heard him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>599</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did he say to you?</question>
  <answer>He said this "I am very glad to see you and I am not either afraid or ashamed to see you". Now what does that imply?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>600</questionnumber>
  <question>Well in my opinion it implies just this, - that he was not afraid or ashamed to meet you or anybody else?</question>
  <answer>Well whatever it implies I hope he will yet repent and come back to us.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, and moves the court to exclude from the record the last twenty four questions and answers.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>601</questionnumber>
  <question>(Question is missing)</question>
  <answer>I knew it was right, and he had his doubts about it for he debated it in his own mind as is shown by his language. I knew it was right sir? Do you think I would have done that, - made that sacrifice and virtually given my life away if I had not known it was right?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>602</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it a question of right or wrong with you?</question>
  <answer>It was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>603</questionnumber>
  <question>Then why did you say Joseph Smith gave himself away when he said it was a question of right or wrong?</question>
  <answer>Well it proved to me, or at least satisfied my feelings that he knew that I was his father's wife. That is what it proved to me sir, - that he knew I was his father's wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>604</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the way you looked at it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>605</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he call on you?</question>
  <answer>He did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>606</questionnumber>
  <question>How did he come to do that?</question>
  <answer>He called on me, for I told him I was very desirous of having a chat with him, but when he called I was not in.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>607</questionnumber>
  <question>You jumped to the conclusion that his father had more wives than one, and that he knew it from what he said?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I did. I knew that his father had more wives than one, - I knew that myself, and I believed he knew it also from what he said, - and I want to say right here now if you will allow me, -</answer>

  <question>Well, you said that you would not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>Well it belonged to this world, for he told it to you in this world?</question>
  <answer>Well I will not say what it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>612</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I insist upon the witness being compelled to answer these questions? My patience is about exhausted with a witness who sets herself up as judge, jury court and all, and so I insist upon the rule being enforced which compels witnesses to answer competent questions.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants object to the question asked the witness and the speech of counsel asking it, for the reason that the question is not competent, and his remarks are uncalled for.</mono>

  <question>Will you answer that question?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>614</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I can't stay here to see to this, but I would like to have you in court where they would put you you in jail for a year or two and see if you would not answer?</question>
  <answer>Well I would like to have you there too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>615</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you can depend upon it if you were there you would get it. Now you say he taught that to you in 1842?</question>

  <question>Were not any of the wives of Joseph Smith members of that society?</question>
  <answer>I presume they were but that has nothing to do with this question that I can see.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>620</questionnumber>
  <question>Please answer my question, Mrs. Kimball,-you are a woman and I have to treat you as I wish to do, with respect. this is a case where I think W am competent to judge of what is competent here and just what is necessary for me to ask you, and I assure you I am not asking you questions out of mere idle curiosity. If you wish to be treated respectfully answer the question I ask you, otherwise I will feel called upon to take steps to enforce my rights, and teach you what they are. your read the church papers at that time, did you not?</question>
  <answer>What time?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>621</questionnumber>
  <question>In 1842 you read the church papers, did you not,-the Times and Season?</question>
  <answer>Well I used to read them occasionally.</answer>

    </pagenumber>you were living there in Nauvoo?
  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>Then you did hear some thing about it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I heard of his scandalous behavior.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>627</questionnumber>
  <question>You say "his scandalous behaviour"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for it was scandalous from what I heard of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>628</questionnumber>
  <question>You were being taught the principles of polygamy at the same time were you not?</question>
  <answer>It was not that I think. I don't think the principle of plural marriage had any thing to do with what he practiced. He was there in Nauvoo I know but I had nothing to do with him or his scandalous doings. I never took the trouble to read about his doings, but I believed he was a wicked man.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>629</questionnumber>
  <question>You believed he was a wicked man?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>630</questionnumber>
  <question>For what reason?</question>
  <answer>Because he acted in a very corrupt manner as I understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>631</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it not Mrs Kimball because he had more women than one, - is that not true Mrs. Kimball?</question>
  <answer>I can't say, for I knew nothing about his affairs at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>632</questionnumber>
  <question>But you were being taught at the same time by Joseph Smith, that it was right?</question>
  <answer>Taught that what was right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>633</questionnumber>
  <question>That a man could have more wives that one, - were you not taught at that very time that that was right?</question>
  <answer>I told you when I was taught that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>634</questionnumber>
  <question>And you said it was in 1842?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>635</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mrs Kimball I want to read you something here that is published in the Times and Seasons on that very subject, - that is the doctrine of plural marriage or the rule regulating marriage in the church at that very time, and which is signed by Wilford Woodruff the present president of the church to which you belong, along with nine or ten other men, and by nineteen of the women in the church at that time, which was during the life of Joseph Smith. It is in the issue of the Times and Seasons dated October 1st 1842. You said you read the church papers sometimes so I want to read to you this communication, - "We, the undersigned members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and residents of the City of Nauvoo, persons of families, do hereby certify and declare that we know of no other rule or system of marriage than the one published from the book of doctrine and covenants, and we give this certificate to show that Dr. J. C. Bennett's "secret wife system" is a creature of his own make, as we know of no such society in this place nor never did."</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the extract that has been read to the witness by the counsel for the plaintiff on the ground that the book from which it has been read has not been identified properly, and for the further reason that there is no evidence to show that the certificate read was ever issued by authority of the church.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>636</questionnumber>
  <question>Let the record show that this is the same book and paper which was identified by Wilford Woodruff while on the witness stand, and by Emily Young previously. Now that certificate is signed by S. Bennett, George Miller, Alpheus Cutler, Reynolds Cahoon, Wilson Law, W. Woodruff, N.K. Whitney, Albert Pettery, Elias Higbee, John Taylor, E. Robinson and Aaron Jackson". Now let us take S. Bennett, - did you know him?</question>

  <questionnumber>700</questionnumber>
  <question>Now to refresh your recollection further I will read from the book identified by Wilford Woodruff as the Times and Seasons when he was on the witness stand yesterday?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to anything being read from the book which counsel proposes to read from, on the ground that it has not been properly identified.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>701</questionnumber>
  <question>I will read to you the same matters that I read to Wilford Woodruff on his cross examination, - "The saints of the last days have witnessed the outgoings and incomings of so many apostates that nothing but truth has any effect on them. In the present instance after the sham quotations of Sydney and his clique, from the bible, book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants, to skulk off the dreadful splendor or spiritual wifery, which is brought into the account as graciously as as if the law of the land allowed a man a plurality of wives is fiendish, and like the rest of Sidney's revelation, just because he wanted to go to Pittsburg and live. Woe to the man or men who will thus wilfully lie to injure an innocent people. The law of the land and the rules of the church do not allow one man to have more than one wife alive at once, but if any man's wife die, he has a right to marry another, and to be sealed to both for eternity, to the living and the dead. There is no law of God or man against it. This is all the spiritual wife system that was ever tolerated in the church, and they know it." Now that is from the Times and Seasons of the issues date Nov 15th 1844, and it is found on page seven hundred and fifteen?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objekts to the extract from the Times and Seasons, or what purports to be a publication called the Times and Seasons for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial to any of the issues in this case, and is not proper cross examination, and on the further ground objection is made that there is no evidence to show that the publication referred to was a publication published by the church, and if so there is nothing to show that it is authentic or that the church ever endorsed the publication referred to, and there is nothing to show that it had authority to speak for the church.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>702</questionnumber>
  <question>This is the book that was identified yesterday by President Woodruff. Now I will ask you if you remember seeing that at the time it was published?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>703</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever hear it read before?</question>
  <answer>Well I have heard of it, but I never read it myself, or heard it read by our people.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>704</questionnumber>
  <question>You knew it was published?</question>
  <answer>I did not know it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>705</questionnumber>
  <question>Now that refers to the plural marriage system that you say was taught to you by Joseph Smith, - that I have read to you out of this book?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>706</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say that was not?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>707</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say that was not the doctrine of the church taught at that time as is claimed in this article I have read to you out of this cook, - that there was no other doctrine taught at that time, on the question of marriage, but what was contained in the book of doctrine and covenants? Do you say that the church had any other system besides this?</question>
  <answer>They had the system that was taught to me in the beginning, and I have never heard that it was changed?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>708</questionnumber>
  <question>You have never heard that it was changed?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not by those in authority.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>709</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever know the system that was taught to you to be held out in the church paper, as the doctrine of the church, at any time before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>710</questionnumber>
  <question>You never knew of that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for it was not published as the doctrine of the church publicly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>711</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the reason?</question>
  <answer>I don't know what was the reason, but I know it was a secret and was not made public to the world.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>712</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever know of its being preached from the stand or the pulpit at any time prior to the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not that I recollect of and I am quite sure it was not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>713</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever know of its being taught or preached either publicly from the stand or elsewhere, by any elder or other person in authority in the church, prior to the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Nave I not told you that it was not made public in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>714</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, was it made public any where else before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>715</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the fact is that you never heard it preached either privately or publicly at any time before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>No sir that is not the fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>716</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that not what you stated?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never said anything about privately at all. I did not say anything about that. What I said was that I never heard it preached publicly, - I did not say it was not taught privately.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>717</questionnumber>
  <question>It was taught privately then?</question>
  <answer>It was to me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>718</questionnumber>
  <question>The question is, did you ever hear it preached privately or publicly to the church, - to the church, mind you, and not to yourself as an individual?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>719</questionnumber>
  <question>The only thing you say about it is that it was taught to you privately?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>720</questionnumber>
  <question>And you never heard it preached to any number at a time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, when it was taught to me it was by myself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>721</questionnumber>
  <question>You and he were alone when he taught it to you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>722</questionnumber>
  <question>And you will not tell what was said?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't think it is necessary to tell what was said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>723</questionnumber>
  <question>You give your conclusion that it was plural marriage that was taught you, and will not tell what was said there, so that the court may determine what it was that was taught you?</question>
  <answer>I don't think it is necessary to tell anything about that at all, - that is something that is sacred to me, and I do not want the mocking and scoffing world to know what it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>724</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now you would tell what was said if you though it was necessary?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>725</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Now you do not want to go on record as saying that at the time the church was publishing through its official organ, that there was not such a thing as plural marriage taught or practiced in the church at

    </pagenumber>that same time you were being taught, and other members of the church were being taught that doctrine in secret, and you made no protest?
  </question>
  <answer>I said that I did not know anything about that. I know what I was taught by the prophet, but that that is published there I did not know anything about it sir at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>726</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know anything about that, or did not at that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not that I remember of now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>727</questionnumber>
  <question>You never made any protests against the system?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not, for I knew that what I was taught was correct.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>728</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you make any protest against this system?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for it was not my place or my business to come out and protest against what did not concern me. It was not my place to do that, and then I knew what I hear was correct and proper, that is what was taught me was correct an proper and beyond that that I had no concern in what other people did. I always held what I heard in that way from the prophet a the most sacred thing on earth to me, and I kept it so as far as laid in my power.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>729</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you agree with Joseph Smith when he was teaching you this principle, that you would guard it as a secret?</question>
  <answer>I entered into no such an agreement. There was no such an arrangement.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>730</questionnumber>
  <question>Then why do you say that what he told you was sacred and not to be revealed?</question>
  <answer>I did not say that it was not to be revealed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>731</questionnumber>
  <question>Then why do you refuse to reveal ti?</question>
  <answer>Well it is not my business not my place to go around and publish to scoffers what passed between the prophet and myself. He would have revealed it himself, had he lived, in his own good time, and then there could be no dispute about it, but he did not have the opportunity unfortunately.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>732</questionnumber>
  <question>Well he never got ready in this world to reveal it, and so that is the reason that I am trying to get it out of you?</question>
  <answer>Well all your efforts will be in vain, because you can't get it out of me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>733</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not take an oath here this morning Mrs. Kimball to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</question>

  <answer>Well sir, I will tell everything except that which pertains to my private life, and that I will not tell fir it concerns no one but myself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>735</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you took the oath with an unexpressed mental reservation to tell only what you pleased?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, I don't consider that it is lawful for a woman to publish all her private affairs to the world.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>736</questionnumber>
  <question>You consider that ladies are privileged in that respect?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>737</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you consider that the law of plural marriage is a private affair that the ladies are only interested in?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but I consider it as the word of God to me, and something that is to be kept sacred and faithfully obeyed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>738</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you consider that it is a private affair.</question>
  <answer>Well it is to me so far as it relates to me.</answer>

  <question>Well if that is the case, - if they are open and free to the world if it will accept them, why not tell me what they are so that I may know whether I wasnt to accept them or not?</question>
  <answer>Because you have not come in at the door, - you have no faith and have not obeyed the gospel, and are not entitled to receive them.</answer>

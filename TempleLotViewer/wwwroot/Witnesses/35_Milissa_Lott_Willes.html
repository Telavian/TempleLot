  <question>Do you and did you know the ceremony that was provided for the church at that time, and was printed in the books?</question>

  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <answer>Well that is the best of my recollection, but I don't remember the words that were used, as I said before, for I had no occasion to remember it. If I had known it would be required of me now I might have had it taken down so I would remember it. I could I suppose have had it taken down by a reporter, and given it in, but my memory don't serve me now to say what it was exactly.</answer>

  <question>I will ask you if that was the ceremony that was used, - "You both mutually agree to be each other's companion, husband and wife, observing the legal rights belonging to this condition, that is keeping yourselves wholly for each other, and from all others during your lives."

  <question>And he agreed to keep himself from his wife for you?</question>
  <answer>You will have to ask him that question, for I can't tell you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>75</questionnumber>
  <question>You can't answer that question?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not ask him what he was doing, and I can't swear to his saying he would or would not. I don't think though that he made any particular promise of that kind. I don't remember of his doing it if he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>76</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't think he made any promise of that kind?</question>

  <answer>I was not one of his mothers, and did not expect to. I respected him as a gentleman, and if he does not respect me as a lady today, he is not the man I took him to be. It is not very long since I had a visit from him, and I always took him to be a gentleman.</answer>

  <question>Well that is not the ceremony prescribed here and that is what you say it was?</question>
  <answer>Well what you read there first is only for time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>116</questionnumber>
  <question>Then there was another ceremony used, was there?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>117</questionnumber>
  <question>There was not?</question>
  <answer>NO sir, it was all the same, only it was for time and eternity. I told you that before. This is not a matter of time alone, for I go on beyond time, and I think there is such a thing as eternity, and very likely you will find out there is too before you are through with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>118</questionnumber>
  <question>Well in the ceremony that was used there, you say you were married for eternity too?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>120</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that in the ceremony?</question>

  <questionnumber>121</questionnumber>
  <question>That which was contained in that ceremony was you were married both for time and eternity?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for time and eternity. All good Latter Day Saints when they were married calculate that they are married for time and eternity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>122</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was that in the ceremony, - that is the question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was. Well now, I couldn't say that it was, but I think it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>123</questionnumber>
  <question>Was anything said about eternity in the ceremony?</question>
  <answer>I told you that to the very best of my ability and knowledge and recollection, I believed it was. That is the best I can do, for I have told you that my memory would not serve me as it once did. I have had a good deal of sickness and trouble and I can't remember every word that was said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>124</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Well I have only asked you to refresh your memory

  </question>
  <answer>Well I have answered you the best I can.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>125</questionnumber>
  <question>Now as a matter of fact do you recollect that anything was said about eternity?</question>
  <answer>Well that is what I calculate was said. It is what has been said in every marriage I had anything to do with, - it was fixed for time and eternity, - both time and eternity, for I considered time was very short and eternity was very lengthy, and I remember that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>126</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>129</questionnumber>
  <question>If you were married to him for time and eternity how did it happen that you were afterwards married to Mr. Willes?</question>
  <answer>Well have I got to tell you all about this?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>130</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes madam, I think you have?</question>
  <answer>Well if I have to tell you I will say I married him for time, I married Mr. Willes for time, and when we meet in eternity we will settle that there, for that is something the laws of today have nothing to do with.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>131</questionnumber>
  <question>You married one for eternity, and one, the father of your children, you married for time?</question>
  <answer>Well that is a matter we will settle afterwards, for that is a matter between God and ourselves, and not a matter that concerns this world.</answer>

  <answer>I don't know that I ever met any.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>146</questionnumber>
  <question>Yet you were acquainted with all these parties that claimed to be his wives? Did you not so state that you were acquainted with them?</question>
  <answer>I was acquainted with them, but I can't swear they were his wives, for I couldn't swear to anybody else only myself. I can't swear to any one else only myself, and that it what I was called here to do, and that is what I have sworn to. I only swear to what I know, and I do that to the best of my ability, for there is loss of things that have happened that I can't remember now.</answer>

  <answer>The revelation that was first given out here, that is, the revelation that they claim our here, was just exactly like the one that was in Nauvoo, and brother Joseph Smith was the one that taught it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>155</questionnumber>
  <question>And you were married without Emma Smith being present?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>156</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know that that alleged or pretended revelation, requires that the first wife shall be present?</question>
  <answer>Well she gave her consent.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>157</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that the way the revelation states it?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>158</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know how that is?</question>

  <questionnumber>159</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say that Emma Smith gave her consent?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>162</questionnumber>
  <question>You were married under that revelation which states that the first wife shall take the hand of the one to be sealed, and place it in the hands of her husband, and Emma Smith did not do that, for she was not there? Is that not the fact? Do you want to be understood as saying that?</question>
  <answer>I came here intending to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, and so far as I have been able I have told the truth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>163</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any doubt in your mind as to that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, what I have told is what I know to be the truth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>164</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was that done?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>165</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you read that revelation when you were at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>No sir, -did I read it at Nauvoo?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>166</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes madam?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>167</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did you get it?</question>
  <answer>I got it from Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>168</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you are sure of that?</question>
  <answer>I am.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>169</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it in print, or was it in manuscript? Just answer that question?</question>
  <answer>Well it was in writing, -it was in manuscript.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>170</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that revelation ever presented to the church there at Nauvoo, according to your knowledge, for acceptance?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is incompetent for the reason that the witness has stated, or it does not appear that that is a matter that the witness has any knowledge of, and is improper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>No sir, I don't know anything about that, I heard it spoken of as going to be presented, but it was not presented according to my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>171</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it presented, to your knowledge, at any time, to the church there at Nauvoo?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons above set forth in the last objection.</mono>
  <answer>Well I can't remember that it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>172</questionnumber>
  <question>I say to your knowledge was it presented to the church there at any time at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Well to my knowledge I can't say that it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>173</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember when it was presented here in Salt Lake City to the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I can't remember that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>174</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember whether it was or not?</question>
  <answer>Well I would not say that it was. I think it was, for I have seen it in print and have read it in print, I have seen it published in print, but I haven't always been to every conference, or every meeting, and I have had a great deal of sickness and trouble in my life, and have not been permitted the privilege of attending a great many of the public meetings, and that is the reason that I can't give as definite an answer as I could if that hadn't been so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>175</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it the law of the church prior to the giving of that revelation that the church would permit a man to have one wife only, or more than one wife?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and four the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and calls for testimony that is not cross examination based on testimony given in her direct examination.</mono>
  <answer>I have given my evidence to the very best of my ability, and I don't know that I can say anything more.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>176</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>177</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it the law of the church prior to the giving of the polygamous revelation, that the church would permit a man to have one wife only, or more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>Well not until that revelation was given.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>178</questionnumber>
  <question>They could not have but one wife until after that revelation was given?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>179</questionnumber>
  <question>Until the time that that revelation was given there could not, one man could have but one wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>180</questionnumber>
  <question>And that revelation was never presented to the church, as you have stated, during the lifetime of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not state that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>181</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did you state?</question>
  <answer>I said in the lifetime of Joseph Smith it wasn't presented to the church to my knowledge. I did not say it was not presented, but I know it was spoken of a good many times in his day, and I have told you that he was the one that preached it, and taught it to me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>182</questionnumber>
  <question>You were a member of the church, were you not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>183</questionnumber>
  <question>The law of the church requiring that one man should have but one wife was in force when you was a member?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>184</questionnumber>
  <question>And you now state that you broke that law?</question>
  <answer>No sir. You know there was a revelation given to him to do so and so, and he told me of that revelation and I received it as law, for it came from Joseph the prophet.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>185</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes I understand, but you say that revelation was not received by the church to your knowledge?</question>
  <answer>Well it was received by the majority of the church I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>186</questionnumber>
  <question>Who received it?</question>
  <answer>Why Joseph Smith received it, and he was the one that showed it to a great many others.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>187</questionnumber>
  <question>You stated that that revelation was never presented to the church to your knowledge?</question>
  <answer>Well I say I have seen it and read it, and heard it spoken of by a great many in the church, but whether it was published to the whole of the church, I could not say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>188</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know it could not be a law to the church until it was presented to, and accepted by the church?</question>
  <answer>Well the fact is I don't know near as much about these things as I wish I did, and I don't remember as well as I used to remember things, for if I did I could tell you a great deal more than I can do now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>189</questionnumber>
  <question>If you and Joseph Smith were married, and he had a wife living, before the church had accepted that revelation as a part of the church articles, were you not both violators of the law of the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>190</questionnumber>
  <question>You were not?</question>
  <answer>I don't think we were.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>191</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't think you were?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I don't think we violated any of the laws of the church, or the laws of the land.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>192</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you wish to stand in the attitude of holding yourself out to the rest of the members of the church that you were a good member of the church, when you have married a man who has a wife living, and the rest of the members of the church hold that a man can have but one wife living at a time?</question>
  <answer>Well it is not that way today, for today a man can have but one wife, and that is the law of the church; but there was a revelation given and received by the church, and lived up to by the church at that time, by which a man could have more than one wife, but that is not the law of the church now, as I understand it; but if everybody would live up to the laws of the church in those days they would live a great deal better than the majority of them do today, a blamed sight better.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>193</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you use the words "a blamed sight better" in your testimony just now?</question>
  <answer>Well now don't ask me no questions that I can't answer. You have worried me so that I don't know what I say, but I am telling the truth all the time. As for education I haven't had but very little, and I have done the very best I could with I did have, and I have done the very best I could in answering all the questions you have asked me, and if I happened to make a little mistake in a word or two, I think that ought to be considered as ignorance on my part.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>194</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you wish to be placed upon record here Mrs. Willes as having married a man under the laws of the church that required that one man should have but one wife, and at that time the church had never accepted any other law but that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>195</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir and I didn't say so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>196</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not say that you married a man at a time when he had another wife living?</question>
  <answer>I say that when revelation was given it was given right and lawful, and it was right and lawful and our duty for us to obey that revelation and live our religion.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>197</questionnumber>
  <question>What revelation do you refer to?</question>
  <answer>That revelation that Joseph Smith got.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>198</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the revelation which permitted a man to have more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>199</questionnumber>
  <question>You say that when that was given you considered it right and lawful for you to marry a man that had at the time a wife living?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>200</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is what you called living your religion?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>201</questionnumber>
  <question>But you - state that the church at that time had not accepted the revelation?</question>
  <answer>I said I did not know, but under the circumstances I hadn't been permitted to go to a great many public meetings or attend conferences. I generally calculated to do so, but owing to a great many different things, sickness and death and trouble of one kind and another I was unable to do so. On this account I haven't been permitted the privilege of attending a great many public meetings, and I can't swear as to what was done only what I saw, or about any other woman's doings only Melissa Willes' doings, and what she did herself. And that is what I have done here today. What I have stated here today is what I know to be facts, and you can't get me to say anything else.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>202</questionnumber>
  <question>Well Mrs. Willes, I will say that all that it is necessary for you to do is to answer the questions we ask you. It seems to me that you are making a good deal of trouble for yourself, and saying a great deal more than is necessary. All that is necessary for you to do is to answer the questions I ask you, but of course if you want to make these explanations you can do so, - I will not object?</question>
  <answer>Well I have said all I have to say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>203</questionnumber>
  <question>Now when you were asked to become the wife of a man who already had a wife, did you not tell him it was contrary to the laws of the church for you to marry him?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>204</questionnumber>
  <question>Why didn't you?</question>
  <answer>I didn't tell him that because I believed he had a revelation from God to do thus and so, He told me so and I believed him, and I believe it yet. I still believe he had a revelation from God to do that, - he told me so and I believe him and that was the reason I married him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>205</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is the reason you married him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir and I done the very best I knew how, then and always. I have tried to live my faith and religion the very best I could, and I will still try to live it to the end.</answer>

  <questionnumber>206</questionnumber>
  <question>You married him, knowing that he had a wife living, at a time when you say you knew the law of the church was to the effect that a man should have but one wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but that was after the revelation was given, - I didn't marry him until after that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>207</questionnumber>
  <question>But you say that you did not know that that revelation, - when that revelation was presented to the church?</question>
  <answer>Well I gave you my reasons, - it was on account of sickness and death and trouble, that I was not able to attend many public meetings, and so I was not as well informed as I ought to be on these things. It was on that account that I have not been permitted to attend very many pubic meetings neither in Nauvoo or Salt Lake City, - not nearly as many as I would like to have attended, and I said to the best of my recollection I could not swear to any such a thing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>208</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you been taught that you may receive in private a doctrine, as a good member of the church, before that doctrine was presented to the church?</question>
  <answer>Before it was presented to the church did you say?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>209</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes madam?</question>
  <answer>What for?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>210</questionnumber>
  <question>Before it was presented to the church for acceptance?</question>
  <answer>I think that doctrine was accepted in a noble way, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>211</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you been taught that you might, as a good member of the church, receive and practice a doctrine, before that doctrine had been presented to the church? That is he question for you to answer?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't think I have. I think I did the very best I knew how.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>212</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't think you have been taught that way?</question>
  <answer>I don't think I have been taught anything only what is true and right and correct. Now that is the way I answer that question, and if I don't get the understanding of your meaning I can't help it, for that is the best I can do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>213</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will ask you to state again, if you married a man under the laws of the church, that you say required at that time, monogamy or monogamous marriage, that is a law which permitted a man to have but one wife, and a woman but one husband, - before the giving of this revelation, - and before the church even received that revelation as a part of its doctrine, to your knowledge?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, not proper croaa examination, and a repetition of matter already inquired into.</mono>
  <answer>I think it was acknowledged when I was married to him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>214</questionnumber>
  <question>What was acknowledged?</question>
  <answer>I think that revelation was acknowledged by the church at that time, and was considered a commandment.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>215</questionnumber>
  <question>Acknowledged by the church?</question>
  <answer>I think it was acknowledged by the church, but I can't swear that it was, but that is my belief.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>216</questionnumber>
  <question>If it hadn't been acknowledged by the church, and you were married under it, in that event would you be a violator of the law of the church?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it calls or an opinion of the witness, and is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>What is the question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>217</questionnumber>
  <question>if it had not been accepted by the church at that time and made a part of the law at the time, would you not have been a violator of the laws of the church, and also would not Joseph Smith if he so acted with you?</question>
  <answer>I don't think I ever violated any of the laws of the church.</answer>

  <questionnumber>219</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now I insist upon answers to my questions?</question>
  <answer>I have answered you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>220</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I beg to differ with you, you do not answer my questions and I insist upon your doing so?</question>
  <answer>Well I have answered them as well as I know how. I have answered you the very best I know how.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>221</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will try it again, Mr. Reporter please read the question I asked, as follows, "If it had not been accepted by the church at that time, and made a part of its laws at that time, would you not have been a violator of the laws of the church at that time, and also would not Joseph Smith, if he so acted with you"?</question>
  <answer>Well I considered it was the laws of the church, and he was our prophet, seer and revelator, and he said that was the revelation he had, and he gave it to us, and told us it was right to do these things and so we violated no law of the church, for when he said that and had the revelation it was the law of the church. We did not violate any law at all, for that was the law of the church at that time, and the laws of the land also.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>222</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I object to that answer for it is not responsive to the question, and we move to have it stricken from the record for that reason. I will ask the question again, and possibly I may get an answer to it, although it seems to be rather hard work. If this revelation you speak of permitting a man to have more wives than one at the some time, had not been accepted by the church at the time of your marriage to Joseph Smith, were you and Joseph Smith not violating the law of the church when you so married?</question>
  <answer>Of course I would if it had not been the law of the church, of course if it had not been the law of the church we would.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>223</questionnumber>
  <question>Joseph Smith as well as yourself would have been a violator of the laws of the church in that event?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, of course that is so, but it was the law of the church, and we did not violate any law of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>224</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you have answered that question all right, and that will do for that branch of the cross examination now you said there were no children born of that marriage?</question>
  <answer>I said I had none.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>225</questionnumber>
  <question>You had none by Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and you asked me why I hadn't any and I told you I couldn't tell you, that you would have to go to some higher authority than I to tell you that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>226</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you said I believe that Emma Smith had children by Joseph?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I told you that I supposed she had. They looked like their father but as to their being his I can't say. I can't swear to anything only Melissa's affairs.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>227</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever room with Joseph Smith as his wife?</question>

  <question>Where was Emma Smith at that time?</question>
  <answer>I don't know I didn't ask where she was.</answer>

  <answer>No sir I didn't.</answer>

  <questionnumber>241</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was she at home?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>242</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know?</question>
  <answer>She was there when I see her last.</answer>

  <question>What time was that?</question>
  <answer>That I saw her?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>244</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes madam?</question>
  <answer>I can't tell you the time. If I had thought to asked all these questions I might have kept a note of all these things, but as I didn't know anything about this examination I didn't.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>245</questionnumber>
  <question>How often did you room there with Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Well that is something I can't tell you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>246</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it more than once?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and more than twice.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>247</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is something I would like to know?</question>
  <answer>Well there is something I would like to know. If I am asked these questions I would like to know this thing that I know, and I can't see any reason in your worring me with these questions, and I would like to know if I have to answer them?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>248</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if you decline to answer them say so, and that will do?</question>
  <answer>I don't decline to answer any question that I know anything about.</answer>

  <questionnumber>250</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you how many times you had roomed there in that house with Joseph Smith? I do not expect you to answer positively the exact number of times, but I would like to have you tell us the number of times as nearly as you can remember it?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't tell you. I think I have acted the part of a lady in answering you questions as well as I have, and I don't think you are acting the part of a gentleman in asking me these questions.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>251</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will ask you the question over again in this form,-was it more than twice?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>252</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how many times?</question>
  <answer>I could not say.</answer>

  <questionnumber>255</questionnumber>
  <question>At what places?</question>
  <answer>At my father's house.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>256</questionnumber>
  <question>At other places did you ever room with him as his wife?</question>
  <answer>Well now I thing that is all the places it is necessary for me to answer plenty of questions on that matter, and all it is necessary for me to answer, and all that you should require of a lady whom you know is telling the truth as best she can.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>257</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever room with Joseph Smith at any other place or places than at the Nauvoo Mansion and your father's house,-that is did you ever room with him as his wife?</question>

  <questionnumber>261</questionnumber>
  <question>You want to go on record here as saying that you cohabited with a man as his wife, and knew at the time you did that he had a wife living, and you don't know whether there was any law of the church or land permitting it at all? Is that the way you want to do on record here?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I told you that it was the law of the church at the time, I considered it the law of the church and it was all right, for I have always lived correctly. The hour of twelve o'clock noon having arrived, the further hearing of the testimony of the above witness was continued until the hour of 1:30 o'clock P.M. at which hour come the parties aforesaid, and the further cross examination of this witness was continued by Mr. E.L. Kelley. It was agreed and stipulated by and between the parties hereto as aforesaid that the signature of the witness to the short-hand notes of her evidence should be, and the same is hereby waived, as well as the signature of this witness and the signatures of all other witnesses whose testimony may be taken, or has been taken in Salt Lake City to their testimony when transcribed by the examiner taking same, shall be and the same is hereby waived. The above agreement applies to the witnesses introduced by both parties hereto.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>262</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you Mrs. Willes what time it was, if you can state it, that you met the present Joseph Smith down at Lehi?</question>
  <answer>Down where?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>263</questionnumber>
  <question>Down at Lehi? Did you not say it was at Lehi?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects and excepts to the reintroduction of this witness for further cross examination, on the ground and for the reason that at the time of the adjournment for noon counsel for plaintiff conducting the cross examination announced that he had concluded the examination of the witness. (At the time of adjournment for noon as above set forth, counsel for plaintiff, Mr. E.L. Kelley, immediately after the close of the answer of the witness above set forth in answer to question number 261, remarked "that is all" as appears in my short-hand notes, but as it was not in the form of a question, and appears irrelevant, the Examiner omitted it from the transcript, and now states the fact in connection with the objection made by the defendants.)</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>264</questionnumber>
  <question>Mention the time as nearly as you can?</question>
  <answer>Well I think it was about four years ago, but I wouldn't say it was then, because I do not remember just when it was, but he was here at the time, and was over at my house, and then he went on down to Beaver by himself, and then came back and called at my house again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>265</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it at your house that he had the conversation with you that you referred to?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>266</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you now if he did not state, if you did not state to him I should say, at that time and place and in that conversation, that you were not married to Joseph Smith, but sealed to him for eternity, and that he never?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't think I told him any such thing. I answered him just exactly as I have answered you here today about it, sealed or married whatever you have a mind to call it; and I quoted over the very ceremony as near as I could to him at that time, but today I can't do it for I am nervous here today, and I can't remember it, but I told him then all about it. I told him the same story that I have told you here about being married to his father.</answer>

  <questionnumber>267</questionnumber>
  <question>And did you not tell him further at that time and place and on that occasion that his father never solicited you to have anything to do with him?</question>
  <answer>I didn't tell him anything of the kind. I told him the same as I have answered you here today, and he wouldn't say but what I told him the same as I have told you here today if he was here either. He would not say that I told him anything different if he was here today.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>268</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not tell him that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I didn't, and I say if he was here he wouldn't tell me that I told him anything different from what I have told you to day.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>269</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is all. I am done this time.</question>

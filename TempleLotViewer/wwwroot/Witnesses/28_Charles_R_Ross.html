  <questionnumber>80</questionnumber>
  <question>You mean those that did not take the oath of allegiance had meetings?</question>

  <question>Well now if they were separated, those who did not take the oath of allegiance from the ones that did take the oath of allegiance, did any of those who took the oath of allegiance and remained hold meetings and pursue the same course that they did before in reference to that?</question>
  <answer>Not that I know of. I never heard them preaching that doctrine there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>82</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you never heard them preaching that doctrine there, who do you mean by the "them"?</question>
  <answer>The ones that took the oath of allegiance. I never heard of them preaching that doctrine there. That is, the ones who took the oath of allegiance.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>83</questionnumber>
  <question>Now as a matter of fact you do not know positively of your own knowledge whether there ever was any such thing as an oath of allegiance?</question>
  <answer>Well I have an idea that it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>84</questionnumber>
  <question>You simply have an idea?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>85</questionnumber>
  <question>And that idea does not amount to positive knowledge?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>86</questionnumber>
  <question>And that idea is gathered from what you heard people talk about it as I understood you to state?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is what I heard at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>87</questionnumber>
  <question>And so far as your personal knowledge goes you do not know anything about it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for I am not an educated man. I never had an education, and I can't tell you what the beginning of it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>88</questionnumber>
  <question>What is your business now?</question>

  <questionnumber>186</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>I could not say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>187</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was it told you that?</question>
  <answer>It was Bill Runnells told me that, and he lived in the north east corner of Caldwell County. There was another man that I was well acquainted with that was in the fight. He was a Tennesean, and he shot a man by the name of Lewis, so he said. He shot that man across the creek on top of the hill, and this Tennesean was there the next summer after the fight and walked out of top of the hill and showed me where he shot the man, - where he stood when he fired the shot, and where the man was that was shot. He shot this man Lewis from the fence on the other side of the creek, and and two years afterwards his remains were taken out of the field and buried, for he was not put in the well with the rest of the, for he was buried about a quarter of a mile from where he was killed. My brother-in-law bought the land and there was a little patch of brush where he was buried, and my brother-in-law wanted to remove his remains, and I think it was the second or third court they had there in the county my brother-in-law went to the court to get an order to do so, and move them to the grave yard, and I think that governor King was the Judge of the Court, and he and my brother-in-law were educated together in Tennesee, and he just said to him, - he said "Billy", for his name was Billy Lane, - he said "there is no need of that order, but you just get your neighbors to take them up and put them away." I was not there when they were taken up, but I was there after they were taken up and were in a box in the house, and I examined them myself and saw the size of the ball he was shot with, and the size was the same as the size of the ball that the man that shot him told me he shot him with, and the hole was right through both blade of the shoulder. Now I saw that with my own eyes, and this man told me he shot him. There is no hearsay about that, for that is something I saw myself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>188</questionnumber>
  <question>Were any of these men ever indicted or brought to justice for shooting these men?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>189</questionnumber>
  <question>Where are they now?</question>
  <answer>They are dead and gone, - both of them. They are not in the land of the living now, but they were never brought to justice for what they did, unless they have been since they died. One of them lived near Utica there, and the other lived in the north east corner of our county.</answer>

  <question>What do you know, if anything, about the bodies of any of the Mormon people being thrown into a well that was there?</question>
  <answer>Well it was sais that they were put in there, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>191</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I do not care about your stating what was said about it, for that would not be testimony. The Court would say that you could not give that kind of testimony. What I want to know is what you know personally about it.</question>
  <answer>All right. Well I will tell you what I know personally about it, and perhaps I know a good deal bout it, - it settled down, - the graves did-</answer>

  <questionnumber>192</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now you know that is the beginning of it. We want to know all you know about it, and do not understand what you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, of this well in which they were put, and of which where can be no manner of doubt. There can be no doubt but that they were put in there, for the next spring when it thawed out, for it was all frozen up when I went there, and when it thawed out in the spring it stunk like an old dead horse. It was a twelve foot well and eighteen were put in there of their own folks, and I told a man that his father was in there.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, "Of course I object to all this because it is hearsay and not relevant to any issues in this case." By Mr. Traber,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>193</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I asked him what he knew personally?</question>
  <answer>Well several men have told me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>194</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it don't matter what "several men have told" you. That is not evidence, what they told you is not evidence and it is not proper to state what they told you. You should only state what you know of your own knowledge, and nothing else. If there was a judge sitting up there heading this testimony he would tell you that it is improper to give such testimony, and would not permit you to do so.</question>
  <answer>Well they were there in that well, there is no doubt of it, for I smelt them like an old dead horse in the spring when it thawed out and the warm weather came on. There is no doubt in the world but they were there, and afterwards I helped fill the well that was their grave up.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>195</questionnumber>
  <question>You helped fill the well up?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, the well, but I call it their grave too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>196</questionnumber>
  <question>What was your object in filling it up?</question>
  <answer>Well it smelt so bad and annoyed me so much, for it was within ten steps of my door and it stunk like a dead horse, and was so bad that I had to do it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>197</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you said you understood there was eighteen people in that well?</question>

  <answer>You sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>199</questionnumber>
  <question>And do you mean to say that all the people that were killed there at Hahn's mill were put in that well?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not all of them. There was this man Lewis that I told you of that was shot by this man through the shoulder blades, he was killed and he was not put in this well at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>200</questionnumber>
  <question>Were all the rest of them put in there?</question>

  <question>How is that?</question>
  <answer>A man from Davies County by the name of Rogers, he belonged to that company that came there to fight the Mormons, and he cut Mr. McBride who was an old gentleman whom I never saw. He attacked him at his house and he ran down to the creek, and this man Rogers overtook him in the creek with a piece of a scythe or corn knife, you have seen them and know what I mean, and he cut him all to pieces with it, and a cut his head off. McBride's family were there when I came there and lived just over east of us.</answer>

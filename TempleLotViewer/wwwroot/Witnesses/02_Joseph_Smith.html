  <question>I wish you would state to the reporter Mr. Smith how the re-organization of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was effected, how it came about, and by what parties it was effected?</question>
  <answer>It began some where in the year 1851 as near as I understand it, bu the meeting together of persons who were or had been members of the church, but who refused to recognize the western authorities, bu their convening themselves together and conferring in regard to the condition as they then existed. After they had done this they issued a call or kid of appeal to the scattered members of the church, and they met in conference in the year 1851, no it was I think in 1852, and appointed some of their number as missionaries, and sent them out to look after the scattered individuals. I became acquainted personally with the movement some time in 1856, by a visit to me of two of them. I united with them in the spring of 1860.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>11</questionnumber>
  <question>What time in the spring of 1860 did you unite with them?</question>
  <answer>It was on April 6th. I met with them in conference at Amboy, in Lee county, Illinois... I had been baptized into the church by my father in the fall of 1843 or the spring of 1844, the date I don't remember, for I have no record of the date. I was received into the re-organized church like others by my original baptism, and became identified with the movement and was chosen to preside over its organization and was ordained as an high priest, and chosen to preside over the body and ordained by them. William Marks; Zenas H. Gurley, and W.W. Blair, -if my memory serves me right were the ones who officiated at the ordination.</answer>

  <questionnumber>17</questionnumber>
  <question>What position did Gurley hold in the old church?</question>

  <questionnumber>18</questionnumber>
  <question>What kind of a meeting was this at Amboy at which you united with the church?</question>

  <questionnumber>22</questionnumber>
  <question>How was that vote taken?</question>

  <question>Was Will Marks present?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but I believe that Zenas Gurley, senior, was the presiding officer of that conference.</answer>

  <answer>It was made up of persons who had been members of the old church principally, with a number that has been baptized by means of their preaching.</answer>

  <answer>Well there may have been present possibly one hundred fifty people. There may have been more for the conference was held in a hall, and it is hard to say just how many were present, but I think there was at least that many.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>28</questionnumber>
  <question>I wish you would state Mr Smith if you can, the number, and given names of the officers who were members and officers in the old original church, that were present at that conference?</question>
  <answer>I think besides Elder Marks and Gurley, there were quite a number present who were members of the old church, but the number I could not state definitely. Now as we speak of I remember that amongst the number that were present was Elder Isaac Sheen; Dwight Webster; Zenas Whitecomb, - I think it was Zenas, - the old gentleman, - Israel L. Rogers; Hiram P. Brown. I don't know that I can now call to mind any more, - in other words I do not know that I can now recall the number, but at the time I doubtless remembered and knew who they were there that were members of the old original church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>29</questionnumber>
  <question>State as nearly as you recollect the number of elders and high priests who wee present, - the high priests and other officers of the old or original church, who prior to the year 1860 had united themselves with the re-organization of the church, or who have since united with it?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not tell you with reference to the number who had untied themselves with the re-organization of the church prior to that time, and I could only make and estimate as to the number who have united themselves with it since that time.</answer>

  <questionnumber>30</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is your estimate as to the number?</question>
  <answer>Well as I said I could only approximate the number, but there must be some thousands of them. The majority part of the old body who were members of the old church have united themselves with the re-organization either on or before 1860. I cannot say as to the period prior to 1860, but since that time there has been a great many of them untied with the church as it now exists. There is my uncle William Smith, and his three sisters, and the husband of the youngest of them, - Milikem, - and William Aldrich; Jon Gaylord; John C. Gaylord; Archibald Wilsey Asa Manchester and a great many others have united with the reorganized church who were members of the old original church.

  <question>I wish you would explain what you mean Mr Smith, when you say it came to your knowledge in 1856?</question>

State just the reason or cause of the disruption? ( Handwriting in right margin first part unreadable. Next part reads: B. Y. acting in unrightful position.)</question>
  <answer>
    So far as I comprehend it, it occurred from the apparent usurpation of authority on the part of President Young and some of his compeers and the practice or teaching of the doctrine,-if it can be called a doctrine,-of the plurality of wives, to which practice and teaching a great many took exception and refused to accede,-my mother and President Marks being among the number, and others that I remember. It was culminating or rather brewing for some time, but culminated as I understood it in the winter of 1846, when a great many of the members of the church refused to follow these teachings and withdrew.

    </pagenumber>political troubles that occured there at that time I do not remember much about as I was too young at the time to retain any very distinct recollection regarding them, and I may say about all I know is what I heard. They were driven out from the city, and scattered around, and a great many of them were scattered all throughout Iowa, and this western country, and a great many more went east and settled down in different places; and the principle cause of this disruption and scattering of the church was due to the introduction of doctrines that were not in accordance with the published doctrines or faith of the church that the people had been taught or baptized into.

  <question>I will ask you Mr Smith to examine page 709, volume 3, of the Times and Seasons, which is marked exhibit "L", as identified by the witness Whitehead, and ask you to state to the reporter whether that contains an epitone of the faith of the old original church, and also of the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "I object to the testimony, because the witness has not shown his competency to speak as to what was the faith of the old original church, and because the book from which he is asked to read, has not been identified as a book containing the doctrine of the original church".

  <question>Will you read that to the reporter? Read to the reporter, beginning at the words "we believe", on page 709, and down to the words "after these things, on page 710, in volume 3?</question>
  <answer>It is as follows, - "We believe in God the eternal Father, and an his Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adams transgression. We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be save by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. We believe that these ordinances are, 1st, - Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; 2nd, - Repentence; 3rd, baptism, by imersion for the remission of sins; 4th, laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. We believe that a man must be called of God by "prophesy", and and by laying on of the hands" by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel, and administer in the ordinances thereof. We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive church, viz; - apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophesy, revelations, visions, healing interpretation of tongues, etc. We believe the bible to b the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God. We believe all that God has revealed, all that he did not reveal, and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of God. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the ten tribes. The Zion shall be built upon this continent. That Christ will reign personally upon the earth, and that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradise glory.</answer>

    We claim the priveledge of worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates of our conscience, and allow all men the same priveledge, let them worship, how, where, or what they may.

    </pagenumber>We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul, "We believe all things, we hope all things", we have endured many things and hope to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely or of good report or praise worthy, we seek after these things.

  <question>You may state Mr Smith whether or not the two epitomes of faith which you have read, - that of the original church, and that of the re-organized church, - are the same, and if they are not the same, state what the differences are in them, and where in the differ if at all?</question>
  <answer>They are mainly alike. There is some differences in regard to the language that is used, and in regard to the question of marriage, - this matter being stated more fully in our re-organized epitome, of faith, and in the enlargement of the texts cited, but the principles are the same in both.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>79</questionnumber>
  <question>What principles, if any are there, in the original epitome of faith, - or the epitome of faith of the original church, that are not contained in the epitome of faith of the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>I do not remember that there is any specific principle, except in regard as I state before, - on the question of marriage, - the principle is the same, but it is enlarged in the epitome of faith of the re-organized church, and specifically mentions the plurality of wives, which is not in the epitome of faith in the original church. There is nothing said at all I believe in the original epitome of faith on that matter".</answer>

  <question>Is there any other form of marriage recognized or endorsed by the Reorganized church, other than what is set out in Exhibit E which you now hold in your hand?</question>
  <answer>
    No sir. The following is a true, correct and accurate copy of section 101, on pabe 251 of Exhibit E, above referred to by the witness in his answer to question 82, to wit, - Marriage 1 According to the custom of all civilized nations, marriage is regulated by law and ceremonies; therefore, we believe that all marriages in this church of Christ of LatterDay Saints, should be solemnized in a public meeting or feast, prepared for that purpose; and that the solemnization should be performed by a presiding high priest, high priest bishop, elder or priest, now even prohibiting those persons who are desirous to get married of being married by other authority. We believe that it is not right to prohibit members of this church from marrying out of the church, if it be their termination so to do, but such persons will be considered weak in the faith of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 2 Marriage should be celebrated with prayer and thanksgiving; and at the solemnization; the person to be married, standing together, the man on the right, and the woman on the left, shall be addressed, by the person officiating, as he shall be directed by the Holy Spirit; and if their be no legal objects; he shall say, calling each by their names "You both mutually agree to be each other's companion, husband and wife observing the legal rights belonging to this condition; that is keeping yourselves wholly for each other, and from all others during your lives", and when they shall have answered "yes", he shall pronounce them "husband and wife", in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the laws of the country and authority vested in him; "may God add his blessings, and keep you to fulfill your covenants from henceforth, and forever, Amen. 3 The clerk of every church should keep a record of all marriages solemnized in his branch. 4 All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is baptized into this church, should be held sacred and fulfilled. Inasmuch as this church of Christ had been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy; we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife; and one woman but one husband, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again. It is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will of her husband, neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband. All children are bound by law to obey their parents; and to influence them to embrace any religious faith, or be baptized, or leave their parents

We believe that all persons who exercise control over their fellow beings and prevent them from embracing the truth will have to answer for that sin. The follow is a true correct and accurate copy of paragraph 7, section 13 to be found on pages 121 and 122 of Exhibit E, referred to by witness in his answer to question 86, to wit, - "And again I say unto you, though shalt not kill put he that killeth shall die. Thou shalt not steal; and he that stealeth and will not repent, shall be case out. Thou shalt not lie; he that lieth and will not repent, shall be cast out. Thou shalt love they wife with all thy heart, and shall cleave unto her, and none else; and he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her, shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit, and if he repents not, he shall be cast out. Thou shalt not commit adultery, and he that commiteth adultery and repenteth not, shall be cast out; but he that has committed adultery, and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive; but if he doeth it again he shall not be forgiven, but shall be cast out. Thou shalt not speak evil of they neighbor or do him any harm. Thou knowest my laws concerning these things are given in my scriptures; he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out."

  <questionnumber>98</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, give what you can of them?</question>
  <answer>
    On page 127, there is an express declaration in regard to the question of having more wives than one. It declares that they are to be confined to one wife. That is found in the second chapter of Jacob, and is as follows, - "But the word of God burthens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord; this people begin to wax in iniguity; they understand not the scriptures; for they seek to excuse themselves in commiting whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David and Solomon his son. Behold David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abonminable before me, saith the Lord; I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, but the power of mine arm that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph. Wherefore, I, the Lord God, will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old. Wherefore my brethern hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord; for there shall not any man among you have, save it be one wife; and concubines, he shall have none; for, I, the Lord God, delighteth in the chastity of women. And whoredoms is an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts".

    </pagenumber>That is about all that it is necessary to quote, but there is more here in this same chapter that bears on the same subject, but I think I have read enough to show that the practice of polygamy is expressly prohibited. Now on page 558 in the book of Ether, so called, there is also a reference to the same matter, and also on page 128. The reference on page 128 is as follows, - "Behold, the Lamanites your brethern, whom ye hate, because of their filthiness, and cursings which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandments of the Lord, which was given unto our fathers, that they should have, save it were one wife; and concubines they should have none; and there should not be whoredoms committed among them; And now this commandment they observed to keep; wherefore, because of this observance in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and one day they shall become a blessed people; Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands, and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you, is because of the iniquity of their fathers". One page 558, the reference is an follows, - "And Riplakish reigned in his stead, and it came to pass that Riplakish did not do that which was right in the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and concubines, and did lay that upon this mens shoulders which was grievous to be borne; yea, he did tax them with heavy taxes; and with the taxes did he build many spacious buildings".

  <question>Now I will ask you Mr Smith whether it was not the duty of every member of the church at all times to obey the law in relation to marriage, as it is set forth in the books to which you have referred, as well as what relates to marriage in the bible, and that it was not the priveledge or within the power of any one to set any of the law aside at their own will?</question>

  <question>On the same subject Mr. Smith is it the duty of members of the church to obey the laws. If so, you may cite and read to the reporter?</question>
  <answer>Paragraph 8 reads as follows, "And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because you have treated lightly the things you have received, vanity and unbelief hath brought the whole church under condemnation. And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all; and they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon, and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that, which I have written, that they may bring forth fruit meet for their Fathers kingdom, otherwise there remaineth a scourge and a judgement to be poured out upon the children of Zion; for shall the children of the kingdom pollute my holy land?

  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>You may turn to the same book, and cite to the reporter section 3, paragraph 11 of the same book?</question>
  <answer>Of necessity there are presidents, or presiding officers, growing out of, or appointed of, or from among those who are ordained to the several offices in these two priesthoods. Of the Melchizedek priesthood, three presiding high priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and uphold by the confidence, faith and prayer of the church, from a quorum of the presidency of the church. The twelve travelling counsellors are called to be the twelve apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ, in all the world; thus differing from other offices in the church in the duties of their calling. And they form a quorum equal in authority to the three presidents, previously mentioned. The seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world. Thus differing from other offices in the church in the duties of their calling; And they form a quorum equal in authority to that of the twelve especial witnesses, or apostles just named. And every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same; that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decisions in order to make their decisions of the same power or validity, one with the other". That is not the whole of the paragraph, but it is about all that bears on this subject I think.</answer>

  <answer>They are the same in substance. That is the reading matter is the same, but the sections have been arranged differently, - that is most of them have.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>111</questionnumber>
  <question>Then I understand you to say the difference is in the numbering of the sections and paragraphs, and not in the text, or in the reading matter?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. The sections are placed in different order, but there is no change in the test. They are referred to in this book (referring to the edition published by the reorganized church) and the sections are referred to in the original publication, - the sections and paragraphs also are given, so that one can find any reference in one book by comparing it with the other.</answer>

As we have lately been credibly informed that an elder of the Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints, by the name of Hiram Brown, has been preaching polygamy, and other false and corrupt doctrines, in the County of Lapeer State of Michigan. This is to notify him and the church in general, that he is further notified to appear at the special conference on the 6th of April next, to make answer to these charges. Joseph Smith Hyrum Smith Presidents of Salt Church By Mr. Southern, - "That is objected to for the reason that no authority for the publication quoted from has been shown and no identification of the book has been shown or made, which makes its utterance authentic or evidence in this case". "I further move that the question just given be stricken from the testimony in this case, because it is not pertinent to any of the issues raised by the pleadings, and is not identified as an utterance authorized by the plaintiffs in this case, or any one whom it represents, ot who represented it, and for the further reason that it does not appear that the names signed thereto are the names of the authors of the publication or notice".

  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "That question is objected to because of the indefiniteness of the question, and because it calls for an opinion of the witness upon matters with which it has not been shown that he is familiar, and because if the publication referred to is an authoritive publication of the plaintiff, there is no evidence to show it".</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>152</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question?</question>
  <answer>It was the authorized publication of the church. It was understood to be so by me until the death of Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith in 1844, and has been so regarded by us, and not by us alone, but by every body else wo has ever had anything to do with the church. That is my understanding of it however, for I do not pretend to say what others may think of it.</answer>

  <question>I will ask you Mr Smith whether or not in all the discussions between the elders of your church, and those of other factions or churches, - between yourself and others factions of the same church or other churches, - whether or not the publication from which I read, being "Exhibit O", is not recognized as the official publication at that time?</question>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, - Well I object that that question because any answer that may be given to it could not under any circumstances be pertinent to the issues in this case".</mono>
  <answer>The book has always bben regarded as an official publication and the authorized publication of the church up to the time of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. It was always regarded as the current official and authorized organ of the church, up to the time, and is so regarded to day.</answer>

  <question>Let the record show that the party asking the question only asks for the reading of the passages referred to, for the books authorized by the church, as to what the attitude of the church was toward the Government of the United States?</question>
  <answer>
    The attitude of the church towards the government of the United States was that of loyalty and obedience as expressed in its records, and in its articles of faith and government. In connection with this answer I will read from Exhibit K, page one hundred and thirty seven, where occurs the following, - "Let no man think that he is a ruler, but let God rule him that judgeth according to the council of his own will, or in other words, him that counselleth, of sitteth upon the judgement seat. Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God, hath no need to break the laws of the land; wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns, whose right is to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet. Behold the laws which ye have received from my hand, are the laws of the church, and in this light shall we hold them forth. Behold, here is wisdom." Again on page one hundred and twenty five of the same book, paragraphs one and two, - I should say paragraphs twenty one, twenty two and twenty three of section thirteen Exhibit E, in evidence, as follows, - Paragraph twebty one, - "Again every person that belongeth to this Church of Christ, shall observe to keep all the commandments and covenants of the church; And it shall come to pass that if any person shall kill, they shall be delivered up and dealth with according to the law of the land; For remember that he hath no forgiveness; and it shall be proven according to the laws of the land". Paragraph twenty two, - "And if any man or woman shall commit adultery, he or she shall be tried before two elders of the church, or more, and every word shall be established against him or her, by two witnesses of the church, and not of the enemy. But if there are more than two witnesses it is better but he or she shall be condemned by the mouth of two witnesses, and the elders shall lay the case before the church, and the church shall life up their hands against him or her, that they may be dealt with according to the law of God. And if it can be, it is necessary that the bishop is present also. And thus ye shall do in all cases that shall come before you. And if a man or woman shall rob, he or she shall be delivered up to the law of the land. And if he or she shall steal, he or she shall be delivered up into the law of the land. And if he or she shall lie, he or she shall be delivered up into the law of the land. If he or she shall do any manner of iniquity he or she shall be delivered up unto the law, even that of God". Paragraph twenty three, - "And if they brother or sister offend thee, thou shalt take him or her between him or her, and thee alone; and

And it shall be done in a meeting and that not before the world. And if thy brother or sister offend many, he or she shall be chastened before many. And if he shall offend openly, he or she shall be rebuked openly, that he or she may be ashamed. And if he or she confess not, he or she shall be delivered up unto the law of God. If any one shall offend in secret, he or she shall be rebuked in secret; that he or she may have opportunity to confess in secret to him or her whom he or she has offended, and to God, and that the church may not speak reproachfully of him or her. And thus ye shall conduct all things.

  <question>Well we offer in evidence Mr. Reporter, second one hundred and two of Exhibit E, at pages 252, 253 & 254, and ask that it be made a part of the record, - the whole of the section?</question>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "Before that goes in we have an objection to the last answer of the witness, - Defendant moves the court to strike out the answer of the witness to the last question for the reasons assigned as objections to the question, and for the further reason that the answer to the question does not contain anything pertinent to the issues made by the pleadings in this case".</mono>
  <answer>
    Section one hundred and two above offered, is in words and figures as follows, to wit, - Section C I I Of Governments and laws in General, - That our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood, we have thought proper to present at the close of this volume, our opinion concerning the same". 1 We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man, and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, either in making laws or administering in relation to them, either in making laws or administering them, for the good and safety of society. 2 We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property and the protection of life. 3 We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same, and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people, (if a Republic) or the will of the Soverign. 4 We believe that religion is instituted of God, and that men are amenable to Him and Him only for the exercise of it, unless the religious opinions prompts them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others; but we do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; that the civil magistrate should restrain crime but never control conscience; should punish built but never supress the freedom of the soul. 5 We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective

II We believe that men should appeal to the civil law for the redress of all wrongs and grievances, where personal abuse is inflicted, or the right of or property infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same; but we believe that all men are justified in defending themselves, their friends and property. and the Government, from the unlawful assaults and encroachments of all persons, in times of /exigen- cies where immediate appeal cannot be made to the 1aws, and relief afforded. 12 We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world; but we do not believe it right to in- terfere with bond servants, nor preach the gospel to, nor bap- tize them, contrary to the will and wish of their masters, or to meddle with or influence them in the lest to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men; sueh interference we believe

  <question>And that it was an authority in the church before in left Nauvoo, Illinois?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>163</questionnumber>
  <question>No will you state whether or not you use the same edition of the Book of Mormon that the Nauvoo church did?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we use the same edition, - that is the Palmyra edition of the Book of Mormon published in 1830 if my memory serves me right as to the date of that edition, - and also one published by ourselves, the re-organized church.</answer>

  <questionnumber>168</questionnumber>
  <question>Well Mr Smith I am not asking you for your understanding, - I am asking you for your positive knowledge on that subject?</question>
  <answer>Well my knowledge is that we are identical in words, - that is they are not all identical as far as the words go. There was an edition got up in Nauvoo at one time and that edition is not exactly the same in words as the Palmyra edition, but the substance and teaching is the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>169</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if you use any edition in your church different from these by authority of your church, state what edition it is?</question>
  <answer>Well we regard them all alike.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>170</questionnumber>
  <question>You regard them all alike?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. We use this one (referring to book in hand) because it is versified and is more easily handled on that account, but we have all of them and they are of equal authority with us, for there has been no specific change in any of the, - that is in any if the Books of Mormon, published by any one that I know anything about.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>171</questionnumber>
  <question>You have also testified Mr Smith that a book of doctrine and covenants is an authority in the re-organized church, and that the same book, or a book of the same name was an authority before the he gira from Nauvoo? Did you not testify to that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>172</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir? That is what you testified to? Now I will ask you if there are different editions of that book?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>173</questionnumber>
  <question>What are those editions?</question>
  <answer>All those that I have seen, - all I have seen that was used in the church at that time is the same as the edition of 1835.</answer>

  <questionnumber>179</questionnumber>
  <question>Are there not what purports to be revelations in some of the later editions of the book called the "book od Doctrine and Covenants", that are not in some of the prior editions?</question>

  <questionnumber>180</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the fact?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>181</questionnumber>
  <question>Then how can you call these bookd identically the same, - if they are of different editions and printed at different times and places, how is it that you can say they are identically the sam?</question>
  <answer>So far as they have been published contemporaneously or purport to give the teachings of the church as it existed in the time prior to the death of my father and Hyrum Smith, and by the body of the church, and were published in book form.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>182</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do I understand you rightly when I understand you to say that some of the later editions have subject matter in them that was not in the former editions?</question>

  <answer>Well I don't know what I can mention them specifically.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>188</questionnumber>
  <question>Well answer the question as nearly as you can?</question>
  <answer>I think however that there was a revelation said to be given some time in 1834 that is not in the later editions.</answer>

  <question>Give you best opinion as to the time in which, or at which I should say, these other editions in which these changes are to be found, were published?</question>

  <question>Then did you testify that the re-organized church from the time, - First I will ask you what time it was the church was re-organized?</question>
  <answer>1852.</answer>

  <answer>Well if my memory serves me right it was the President of the church, the twelve, the high priests, the seventy and the elders.

  <questionnumber>233</questionnumber>
  <question>And so these delegates of which you speak, are elected by the local churches or branches, each branch being entitled to how many delegates I would ask?</question>
  <answer>Well if it was an insolated branch I don't know that I could give you the exact representation it would be entitled to, but if the number of members is over twenty it is entitled to two</answer>

  <question>What is the member of a quorom, - what does it take a constitute a quorom in point of numbers?</question>
  <answer>There has never been any designated number required to form a quorom. 246 (Question and answer are missing)</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>247</questionnumber>
  <question>What I want to know is what part of the membership present it takes to constitue a quorom?</question>
  <answer>There is no specific number designated, or understood to form a quorom. That is there is no specific number designated to form a quorom.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>248</questionnumber>
  <question>Now how are the proceedings of these annual conferences that you have described kept?</question>
  <answer>They are kept by secretaries. I might say in explanation that they are kepr through the permanent secretary of the church being present with his assistants, and keeping a record of the proceedings of the conference. If he is not present then the proceedings are kept by persons selected temporarily to perform that duty, and report to the secretary.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>249</questionnumber>

  <question>You do not?</question>

  <questionnumber>485</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then do I understand you to say that a revelation may be authentic without being before the branches, - without being submitted to the quoroms?</question>
  <answer>It is owing to the nature of the revelation. Let me explain, for instance, - a man may be called and ordained in the body or branch. In a congregational organization he may rise and speak what he considers is the voice of the Spirit, and be ordained by reason of this manifestation, without the matter being submitted to the different quoroms, but if it is a matter to be presented to the body; and to become a rule of action for the general body it must be presented in that way; but in rising in many local congregation on any emergency it must be acted on immediately by the voice of the people there assembled.</answer>

  <questionnumber>550</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you familiar with this book entitled Exhibit E?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>551</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you are familiar with this book?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, reasonably so, I cannot say that I am thourougly familiar with it, but I am safe in saying I am reasonably familiar with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>552</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you read it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>553</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see in that book the words "Church of Jesus Christ"? Did you ever see these words in that books?</question>
  <answer>I could not say from memory whether I did not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>554</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is your best recollection as to that?</question>
  <answer>I really could not say whether I ever did or not, - I cannot say from recollection as to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>555</questionnumber>
  <question>You notice the fifth resolution I believe in this book entitled Exhibit N?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>556</questionnumber>
  <question>In the resolutions of what conference is that?</question>
  <answer>It is in the record of the conference of June 1852, - June 12th I believe 1852.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>557</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then Mr Smith if the quotation in Exhibit M, of resolution five in exhibit N, on page three, reads, "Church of Jesus Christ" the word "Jesus" is an interpolation is it not?</question>
  <answer>No sir. It is in the body of the resolution offered at the time and passed by the people.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>558</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you probably don't understand my question. In the resolution to which we have just referred that was put in testimony yesterday the word "Jesus", is not contained. It is there the "Church of Christ". Now if in this epitome, - if the word "Jesus" is in there as a quotation from that resolution, it is an interpolation is it not?</question>
  <answer>I believe so, but it is not in the epitome however, - it is in that quotation from the resolution.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>559</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I say if it is in the epitome, -?</question>
  <answer>But it is not in the epitome. It is in fact properly quoted from that record.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>560</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir it is contained in what is called the epitome of the doctrine?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>561</questionnumber>
  <question>Then if it is in exhibit M entitled "Faith and practices of the Church from 1830 to 1844" as a quotation from the record of the conference at Newark in 1852, it is an interpolation?</question>
  <answer>If the words that are in this printed document don't occur in the resolution they are necessarily an interpolation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>562</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is what I thought. Now is it not a fact Mr. Smith that if the 1835 edition of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, marked Exhibit E, in section two, the church is denominated the "church of Christ", that it is not properly named in said section?</question>
  <answer>I could not say as to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>563</questionnumber>
  <question>You could not say as to that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>564</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then would you say that it is properly designated?</question>
  <answer>I would say this colonel, that if it be the same body, it is immeterial as to what specified name be given it by writers writing about it or by documents in reference to it. It may be called the "Church of Christ", the "Church of Jesus Christ", the "Church of Christ Jesus", or the "Church of Latter Day Saints", or the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints", or what the denominated title of the church was at the time, and whatever the title of the church has been since that time is immeterial. I do not know what the title of the church was before I became connected with it. Only from the information I can gather about it by reading and otherwise, but what the title of the church has been since my connection with it I am prepared to testify about.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>565</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Are you prepared to testify that if the name of the church at

      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0003-Pages_48-166-ORIGINAL/44.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 90</a>
    </pagenumber>the time of your fathers Presidency had been the Methodist church and your church was called or designated as it is that it would make no difference?
  </question>
  <answer>I can't see that it would if the churches were the same. The name has very little to do with it if the doctrines, rules and practices of the church are the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>566</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you prepared to say that the purport would be the same if the name in the original church has been the Methodist church</question>
  <answer>No sir I am not prepared to say as to what might have been the distinctive title of it prior to my connection with it, except as I get it from my history.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>567</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, What are we trying to settle here, is what was the name of the church from 1830 to 1834 particularly?</question>
  <answer>Particularly?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>568</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, - what was the particular, specific name of the original church during that period?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>569</questionnumber>
  <question>That is something you are not prepared to testify about?</question>
  <answer>I can testify in a manner of corse, but I am not prepared to testify of my own knowledge for I do not know anything about it from actual personal knowledge and experience, but only as I gather it from history.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>570</questionnumber>
  <question>Well as the history on these matters is quite voluminous, let me inquire of you if you have read that history?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir to some extent.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>571</questionnumber>
  <question>To what extent have you read it?</question>
  <answer>I have read it partially.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>572</questionnumber>
  <question>Let me enquire of you further whether from 1830 to 1834 the church was not uniformly styled the "Church of Christ"?</question>
  <answer>The history as I read it says that it was called the Church of Latter Day Saints", in the histories that I have read referring to the question or matter of name. I don't know that it was given specifically in all the cases as the name, but the reference to the title or name of the church appears in all these forms.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>573</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you sure that such was the case prior to 1834?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I know it only as I get it from history.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>574</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you sure that history so states it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Well now I will qualify that by saying that that is my remembrance of having so read it. That is the only means of knowledge I have. Of course I was there at the time, but it was only as a child and of course I don't recollect how that was, but that is my recollection of my reading upon the subject. Of course as a cild I could not remember or be expected to remember what the distinctive title or name of the church was at that time, so from my personal actual knowledge and observation I could not tell you what the name was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>575</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you read the Book of Mormon?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>576</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any statement in it indicating that there was a dispute over what the name of the church should be?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>577</questionnumber>
  <question>There is a statement of that nature?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>578</questionnumber>
  <question>And was that question settled?</question>
  <answer>I think not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>579</questionnumber>
  <question>And it is not so stated as settled in the book of Mormon is it?</question>
  <answer>I do not know. I do not so understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>580</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Well would you recognize this what I am not going to read from Exhibit D on page five hundred and seven as an authoritive statement of the matter there in contained. It is as follows, - "And they which were baptized were called the Church of Christ" I will go on and read further from the following paragraph, - "And it came to pass that as the deciples of Jesus were journeying, and were preaching the things which they had both heard and seen, and were baptizing in the name of Jesus it came to pass that the deciples were

    </pagenumber>gathered together, and were united in nightly prayer and fasting. And Jesus again showed himself unto them for they were praying unto the Father in his name; and Jesus came and stood in the midst of them and saith unto them, what will ye that I shall give unto you? And they saith unto him, Lord we will that thou wouldst tell use the name where by we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people concerning this matter. And the Lord said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you, why is it that the people should murmur and dispute about this thing? hath they not road the Scriptures which you must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name, for of this name ye shall be called at the last day; and who so taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day; therefore whatever ye shall do, ye shall do in my name; therefore ye shall call the church in my name, and ye shall call upon the Father in my name that he shall bless the church for my sake; and how be it my church save it be called in my name". Now that is what was found on page five hundred and seven, and on page five hundred and fourteen of the same book Exhibit D, there is the following, - "And it came to pass that the thirtieth and fourth year passed away, and also the thirty and fifth, and beheld the deciples of Jesus had formed a church of Christ in all the lands round about", and on page five hundred and sixteen the following, - "And from that time forth they did have their goods and their substances no more common among them, and they began to divide into classes, and the began to build up churches unto themselves to get gain, and began to deny the true church of Christ". Still further down on the same page appears the following, - "and again there was another church, which denied the Christ, and they did persecute the true church of Christ because of their humility and their belief in Christ. Now the question was do you recognize that as authoritive teaching from the Book of Mormon?
  </question>
  <answer>I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>581</questionnumber>
  <question>You recognize that as the authoritive teachings of the book of Mormon?</question>
  <answer>I do so far as it is read.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>582</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any other name than "the Church of Christ" given in the book of Mormon?</question>
  <answer>The same author, - the same individual, said my name is Jesus Christ specifically.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>583</questionnumber>
  <question>How is that?</question>
  <answer>The same individual whose language you have read said "my name is Jesus Christ", and in the bible it is so recognized that that is his name. That is the name in which his deciples are to do everything they do, - the name of Jesus Christ, and if you will read the whole book. It called, - I should say if you will read the whole book through you will find that those quotations are only partial for it is called the "Church of Christ" precisely the same way that it is called in this resolution.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>584</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any other official declaration of the church any where, after the publication of this declaration in the Book of Mormon, other than that there specified?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir, there is a book of commandments.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>601</questionnumber>
  <question>What place in the laws of the church does that book hold?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that it hold any. It does not hold any place by itself.</answer>

  <question>The re-organized church which you represent, then as I understand you to say doe snot endorse or hold the book of commandments to be a book of authority in your church?</question>

  <questionnumber>603</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you accept all the matter in the book of comandments as published?</question>

  <question>Well do you recognize all the doctrines as taught in the book of commandments?</question>
  <answer>I could not tell you that colonel. The book of commandments was a fragmentary work, the publication of which was interrupted here in this very city and the leaves scattered, and subsequently to that it was, - a committee was appointed or selected whose work it was to compile that book, but as the work was uncompleted, and never accepted or passed upon by the church, we never regarded it as an authentic publication.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>607</questionnumber>
  <question>Who never regarded it as an authentic publication?</question>
  <answer>The re-organized church never did.</answer>

  <question>I asked you if it is not a fact that the re-organized church only regards that part of the Doctrine and Covenants as authentic which the re-organized church transferred from the book of commandments to the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>We recognize the Book of doctrine and Covenants as authorized by the church in 1835 as the declared law of the church to govern it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>610</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that you only regard that part of the book of commandments, which was transferred to the book of covenants as authentic?</question>
  <answer>I will not answer that question for the reason that I don't know anything about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>611</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you don't know anything about that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and I will simply state that the book of commandments was an uncompleted work, and was in fragmentary condition. It was not a completed work as we understand it, and it is not accepted by us as authentic. I will state further that our book of covenants is sometimes called the book of commandments and covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>612</questionnumber>
  <question>Is the name "Doctrine and Covenants" the first name of the book that is presented here as the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>

  <questionnumber>616</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it seems to me that it is money or lots that you are after.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That is not testimony.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>617</questionnumber>
  <question>No sir, - don't put that down?</question>
  <answer>I did not think you wanted it to go down.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>618</questionnumber>
  <question>Well yes sir, I don't care, - that can go down if you want it? Now is it not a fact that the re-organized church has changed the name from that of the book of commandments to that of the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>I am not aware that that is the fact sir. In putting that binding on them may have put the label "Doctrine and Covenants."</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>619</questionnumber>
  <question>When in right and truth, - in fact and truth the right designation would have been the cook of commandments?</question>

See the Millenial Star, volume 16, pages 117, 130, 131, et. hand April 26th 1838 Joseph the seer received a revelation saying, - "Verily thus saith the Lord, my church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints scattered abroad in all the world for thus it shall be in the last days, - Millenium Star, Volume 16, pages 147 and 148".

  <questionnumber>637</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the object and purpose of that publication?</question>
  <answer>It was in response to a question asked, and they are given there for just what they are worth, and what they purport to be. That is all they claim to be and all that is claimed for them, and we give our authority.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>638</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you or do you not consider the authorities from which you quoted as authentic?</question>
  <answer>We considered them as being indicative of what the understanding at that time was, and as evidence touching the name of the church, and the value that was to be given to them as according.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>639</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did you get authority for addition to the name of the church of the word "re-organized"?</question>
  <answer>From the fact understood by us that it was a re-organization of the elements into a new organization or rather a gathering together again of the elements of the church that had been scattered abroad.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>640</questionnumber>
  <question>You say that was a fact?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that the conditions existed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>641</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did you get that fact?</question>
  <answer>We got it sir from the logic of events.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>642</questionnumber>
  <question>What events?</question>
  <answer>Things that transpired, and the membership that was gathered together in that way from different sections.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>643</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recognize in your church the rule of the logic of events?</question>

  <questionnumber>644</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you recognize the logic of events of every character whatever as rules for the guidance of your church?</question>

  <answer>It appears to be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>648</questionnumber>
  <question>Well can't you give any other reason as to why you adopted or took possession of the word "re-organized", as an addition to the title of your church?</question>
  <answer>We adopted that word as a kind of a distinctive title from that of the church in the Utah Valley at Salt Lake, or Deseret.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>649</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you get the authority for its adoption by revelation?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <question>Well that is so much settled, - or did you get it by revelation?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <question>Did you get it out of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>

  <answer>No sir, nor did we get it out of the bible.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>654</questionnumber>
  <question>Nor out of the bible did you get it?</question>
  <answer>no sir, nor out of the book of commandments, nor out of the Timea & Seasons, nor the Millenium Star. We did not get it out of any of them Colonel.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>655</questionnumber>
  <question>Nor the Herald?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>656</questionnumber>

  <question>When was the church first designated as the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>I could not give you the date.</answer>

  <question>At what conference?</question>
  <answer>I could not tell you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>660</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it called the re-organized church at the time you became a member in 1860?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>661</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it called then?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that any title had been agreed upon. I do not know that any title had been agreed upon at that time.</answer>

  <question>That was in 1860?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>663</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the time you were elected President?</question>

  <question>I asked you if from that time down to the present time you have been the head of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>666</questionnumber>
  <question>What is your office called, - what is the position you hold?</question>
  <answer>presiding elder.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>667</questionnumber>
  <question>Would you not have known about so important a thing as a change in the name, or an addition to the name of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>668</questionnumber>
  <question>And would you not have known distinctly at what time such a change was proposed, and at what time such a change in the name of the church took effect?</question>
  <answer>I would have known the time it took place, but to give you the date is some thing I could not do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>669</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now was the reason of the change of the name, or the addition to the name of the word "re-organized" made, or the addition to the name of the word "re-organized" made, after some additional revelations had been placed in the book, of doctrine and covenants at that time?</question>
  <answer>
    I think not. I don't think there was any additional

    </pagenumber>made to the book of doctrine and covenants at that time.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>670</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not testify yesterday that additional revelations were put in the book of doctrine and covenants in about the year 1879?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>671</questionnumber>
  <question>You testified that additional revelations were put in the book of doctrine and covenants then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>672</questionnumber>
  <question>And did you not testify that about fifteen pages were added then?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember that I stated the number of pages, but probably it was fifteen.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>673</questionnumber>
  <question>And is it not a fact that the additions were made to the book of covenants making the change of name very appropriate?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that is not a fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>674</questionnumber>
  <question>You say that is not a fact?</question>
  <answer>I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>675</questionnumber>
  <question>Wouldn't the change of a name of of a religious body, or any other body be very appropriate when there is a change made in the rues or regulations governing that body, or when there are different rules or regulations made governing that body?</question>
  <answer>I don't understand the question Colonel.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>676</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if it is not a fat that a change of the name of a body, religious or otherwise would be very appropriate when there is a change of the rules or regulations governing that body?</question>
  <answer>No sir not exactly. I don't see it in that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>677</questionnumber>
  <question>Would it be the same body after the change in the rules and regulations regulating and governing it were made, as well as a change of name is made?</question>
  <answer>Ye sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>678</questionnumber>
  <question>That would not make any difference?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>679</questionnumber>
  <question>Would it be the same body, although the name might be the same, after the rules and regulations for its government were changed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>680</questionnumber>
  <question>You say it would be the same body after these changes were made?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>681</questionnumber>
  <question>So then if you had a dozen or any other number of rules and regulations made for the government of any body, religious body I will say, and afterwards you were to add one hundred other and supplementary rules and regulations, you maintain it would be the same body?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>682</questionnumber>
  <question>Please explain how you arrived at that conclusion?</question>
  <answer>It would be the same unless there was a radical change made in its organic structure of faith and doctrine, it would remain the same body if the rules and regulations you supposed were in harmony with its organic laws, and there would be no material change in its rules of government, and particularly would this be the case if the same body of people substantially remained with it and came under the government of these rules and regulations.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>683</questionnumber>
  <question>But if there were additions to its rules of government and doctrine, wouldn't it logically follow that these additions made it or constituted it another body, and gave it another distinct individuality?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is immeterial and incompetent and calls for an opinion of the witness, which is not evidence in this case.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>684</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question?</question>
  <answer>Not necessarily, if the membership remained the same without antagonizing. In that case it would remain the same governed by different rules. That is all there would be to that. I should say it would be the same body governed by additional rules, and there was no conflict in the organic structure of the church ot body effected.</answer>

  <questionnumber>685</questionnumber>
  <question>So then it is the same church even if it has additional laws to govern it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>686</questionnumber>
  <question>And different doctrine and an addition to its name?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, so long as they are not in conflict with its organic laws and fundamental principles. It does not necessarily follow under these conditions that it is another body because of these facts if there be no conflict in the rules and regulations of its organic structure.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>687</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr Smith there is no conflict in the organization of the bodies of John Crow and James Crow, and yet they are the same bodies?</question>
  <answer>Well if there are two men and one is John Crow and the other is James Crow, they may be identically alike in composition and yet be different bodies. They certainly are different bodies for one is John Crow and the other is James Crow and they have seperate and distinct organization and existence. I do not think that your simile is quite perfect in its application to this case Colonel.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>688</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then if they appear to be very much alike it would be very proper to give them different names wouldn't it?</question>
  <answer>Most assuredly if they were two different and distinct bodies, - as they certainly would be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>689</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now then if one lived in 1830 and died in 1844, and the other was born in 1852, could they under any circumstances be the same man?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, figuratevely speaking, in a sense they could be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>690</questionnumber>
  <question>How could that be?</question>
  <answer>They could present the same interest and other constitutional identities, that attached one to the other by succession, but not withstanding this fact they would not necessarily represent or stand for the same individual.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>691</questionnumber>
  <question>How can you re-organize a dead body?</question>
  <answer>Well we don't propose to do that. In this case the body was alive all the time, although for a time its vitality was very low.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>692</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you don't propose to organize a dead body?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not if it is once dead.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>693</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is just what you did do though? You attempted to do it at any rate, and I would like to to know the modus operandi that is to be followed in achieving that result.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that the same is irrelevant and immeterial.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>694</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how did you re-organize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints if such a thing was done?</question>
  <answer>Those individuals who had been members of the original church got together, as they had the undoubted right to do, and renewed their faith by entering into a representative organization, few at first it is true, but graduall gathered others unto them by calling others who had also been member of the original church during the life time of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and who listened to their proposition. That was the way it was done, and out of the scattered remnants of the original church who had remained steadfast in the faith, so gathered together the work of re-organization was begun and carried through to its sucessful consumation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>695</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then I understand your answer to mean this, - that when the original church left Nauvoo, Illinois, that a number of the people who had been its adherents remained behind, and that in and about the year 1852 they came together and organized a church upon the same principles as had formerly existed on the regulation and government of the church at Nauvoo? Now do I state that proposition fairly, for I tried to state it fairly.</question>
  <answer>
    Well I can't say what

    </pagenumber>you understood me to say about that.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>696</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I asked you in making my statement, and stated that was what I understood you to say, and asked you if I understood you and had made a fairir statement of what you had stated?</question>
  <answer>Well I suppose that is substantially what I stated. What I stated was that at the time of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith there was a change of administration, which a great many of the adherents of the church at the time, couldn't and did not accept, and that these parties scattered throughout a great many different counties in the state of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, and having confidence and faith in the church to which they had belonged, and having been consistent member of it, they essayed an organization upon the principles of existing prior to the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith".</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>697</questionnumber>
  <question>My what authority did they meet?</question>
  <answer>By the authority that all individuals had to meet who were constitutional member of the church before its fall.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>698</questionnumber>
  <question>Did a single individual have any right to assemble the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir not any single individual member, but he had a right to commence the movement however.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>699</questionnumber>
  <question>Did a dozen individuals have a right to assemble in a church of their own free will and accord?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>A dozen individuals had the right to call an assemble and meet for that purpose?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>Was there any restriction on that right?</question>
  <answer>No sir, only they of course must have been member of the old original church, or had been members of that church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>702</questionnumber>
  <question>If they had been members of the church they had that right?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>703</questionnumber>
  <question>Now were those people members of the church after the church as you claim had been dissolved?</question>
  <answer>I am not aware of the fact that I have made any such a statement or claim. The church had not dissolved, for they were its members, and had the undoubted right to claim privelege of exercising the rights of membership. They were undoubtedly members, and were in reality of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>704</questionnumber>
  <question>Had they be attending church?</question>
  <answer>They had some of them in certain places. Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>Had they been attending conferences?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>706</questionnumber>
  <question>Why not?</question>
  <answer>For the simple reason that none had been held by these who believed with them, but conferences had been held by others, parties who afterwards came into the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>707</questionnumber>
  <question>How were the conferences held by the did church?</question>
  <answer>In the usual way that conferences were held.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>708</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I mean with reference to the time of holding them, - were the hold annually?</question>
  <answer>I think they were both semi-annually and annually. In the spring and fall I think there were held.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>709</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that according to the law of the church?</question>
  <answer>It was according to custom.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>710</questionnumber>
  <question>That was not according to the law?</question>
  <answer>No sir for the law simply says they shall meet from time to time. That is a matter that the church fixed itself, and it was fixed according to custom and convience I assume. There was an interval of some months, - six months I suppose between the dates of the semi-annual conferences.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>711</questionnumber>
  <question>Then these scattered people who met in 1852 did not meet in accordance with any custom did they or any law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they met in accordance with the custom.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>712</questionnumber>

  <question>Now who notified them to come together at Newark, Wisconsin?</question>
  <answer>I couldn't tell you that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>716</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know who it was notified them to come together at that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>717</questionnumber>
  <question>Did any one notify them to come together?</question>
  <answer>Well that I can't tell you either. That was before my day, and I have no personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding that gathering.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>718</questionnumber>
  <question>You cannot say anything about that?</question>
  <answer>No sir for the reason that that conference was held in 1852, and I became connected with the church at first in 1860. That was before the time that I became identified with the movement by eight years, - seven or eight years.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>719</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then you state that you took no further, - that you did not go with the church to those of them who left Nauvoo in 1846 or 1847 and went to other places, and that there was quite a number of others that refused to go also, and that your refusal was based upon additions to the doctrine and practices of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>720</questionnumber>
  <question>Of those who went?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I so stated.</answer>

  <questionnumber>722</questionnumber>
  <question>And you considered that you were dong right in such refusal?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "All this is immeterial and incompetent and irrelevant and it is objected to for that reason. I also object to it for the reason that it is not cross examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>723</questionnumber>
  <question>And yet you say that afterward, - after you became a member of the church in 1860 that additions to the rules and doctrines of the church were made, and yet you stayed with the church, although after the dispersion of Nauvoo you refused to go with the church because of additions that had been made to the rules and practices of the church?</question>
  <answer>I don't understand the question. 724 (Written as 624)</answer>
  <question>You testified that you refused to go with the church or any of the branches of it after the dispersion in 1846 or 1847 because of the fact that additions had been made to the rules and practices of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - that is what I stated I believe. 725 (Written as 625)</answer>
  <question>And yet you joined this church, - the re-organized church, so called in 1860, and although there has been additions made to the rules and practices of that church since that time you do not refuse to leave it?</question>
  <answer>There was no rule or doctrine changed or added that differed in any material degree from what was in the original church, - nothing that was in any respect in conflict with the organic structure of the church as it existed in the days of my father.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>726</questionnumber>
  <question>After you became a member of the re-organized church there was additional made to the book of doctrine and covenants, and yet you did not see proper to leave it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not.</answer>

  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>729</questionnumber>
  <question>Now those you objected to originally were in your opinion subversive of the rights of the people and the doctrines of the church, - that is in your opinion they were?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>730</questionnumber>
  <question>And those additions added on the rules and regulations by the re-organized church, in your opinion were not subversive of anything?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>731</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the way it is?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>732</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the authority that has governed you in this matter has been your opinion?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>733</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what has governed you if it has not been your opinion?</question>
  <answer>The rules and organic structure of the church, - its doctrine and faith and principles as laid down in the recognized standards are the basis, or furnish the basis upon which my opinions were based.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>734</questionnumber>
  <question>Well after all it has been your own individual opinion that has governed you has it not?</question>
  <answer>My estimate of these things as a matter of course governs me in my choice of principle and doctrine.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>735</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it not a matter of fact the individual opinion of all these other parties who joined you in this movement the influence which governed them?</question>
  <answer>I do not know what governed them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>736</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you know anything else that did govern them?</question>
  <answer>I could not say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>737</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know what there motives were or have been?</question>
  <answer>No sir I do not know what there motives may have been. I cannot say what a persons motive may have been unless I see the evidences of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>738</questionnumber>
  <question>But you knew at the time as I understood you to say, that the church was re-organized in 1862 in consequence of any revelation or any authority contained in any of the books that are recognized as authority in the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't know that. They affirmed that they were directed by revelation, but whether they were or not that is a matter for them to testify to and not me, - that is a matter of their testimony and not mine.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>739</questionnumber>
  <question>They affirmed they were led by revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>To what extent?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say, but to a greater or lesser extent.</answer>

  <question>Do you affirm that you were led by revelation also?</question>
  <answer>I was in respect to uniting with them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>742</questionnumber>
  <question>So then if the affirmations of these people who re-organized the church in 1852 is correct, it was re-organized at that time in pursuance of revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir by revelation or direction to that effect.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>743</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it by revelation?</question>
  <answer>That is what they say but of course I cannot say as to that. That is a matter that I am not competent to prove.</answer>

  <questionnumber>758</questionnumber>
  <question>You may answer the question?</question>
  <answer>My understanding of the matter is this, - persons invested with a right of membership in the church did not lose the right, or that right I should say, - the right of the membership because of the introduction into the church of now doctrines and teachings which they held to be pernidious or incorrect doctrines, because of their conflict with the fundamental principles of the church into which they had been baptized, and these parties remained in the regions round about, - one in one direction, and one in another. They had done this prior to the conference of June 12th 1852, although that was the first regular conference that had been held after the dispersion. They had not together in small bodies prior to this and had agreed among themselves and by a call to others to meet together at Newark, Wisconsin, on that day for the purpose of taking into consideration what they should do in reference to their membership, and whether they should take part in effecting an organization. Now that is the way I understand it, but what moved them to that course personally I do not pretend to say.</answer>

    </pagenumber>who was present at that gathering, I think the one who presided at that conference, and he gives an historical statement which is accepted by the re-organized church as a true statement.

  <question>Has or has not one Z.H. Gurley published a history of that organization, and the subsequent action up to the time you became a member of the church, which is received by the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>I think he wrote an article which is entitled perhaps a history of the re-organized church, or of the organization, and it was published perhaps in the Herald. I do not know that it was even completed, by it was simply published as his statement, and so stands in the column of the Herald.</answer>

  <question>Where do you find that law?</question>

  <question>Did it, or did it not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for the right of revelation inheres to every member of the church who is possessed of the gift but the gift to a receive revelation for the church and its guidance inheres in the presidency of the church, and what ever purports to be revelation is still tested, as has been the custom.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>807</questionnumber>
  <question>Well Mr Smith you may state again what the custom has been in that respect?</question>
  <answer>It is our understanding according to the light we have, that whatever purports to be a revelation for the doctrine or government of the church or affecting either in any material issue, when received before it becomes authority, must be presented to and acted upon by the presiding quoroms of the church, the Presidence, the twelve and the seventy especially.</answer>

I also offer in evidence section one hundred and fifteen, entitled "Revelation given March 1863 on page three hundred and thirty seven as follows,- 1 Hearken unto me, O ye elders of my church, Lo I have seen your efforts in my cause, and they are pleasing, unto me. I declare unto you it is my will that you ordain and set apart my servant William Marks, to be a counsellor to my servant Joseph, even the President of my church, that the first Presidency of my church may be more perfectly filled. And more over it is expedient in me that my elders in going to declare my gospel to the nations, shall observe the pattern which I have given. Two by two let them be sent, that they may be a help and a support to each other in their ministry. Press onward ye elders and people of my church, even my little flock, and as I have spoken to you in times past, so will I again speak to you as my friends, inasmuch as you speak in my name; and lo, I am Alpha and Omega, and will be with you unto the end, Amen".

Conserning the matter ye have asked me; Lo, it is my will that my gospel shall be preached to all nations in every land, and that men of every tongue shall minister before me. Therefore it is expedient in me that you ordain priests unto me, of every race who receive the teachings of my law, and become heirs according to the promise. 2 Be ye careful for many elders have been ordained unto me, and are come under my condemnation, by reason of neglecting to lift up their voices in my cause, and for such there is tribulation and anguish; haply they themselves may be saved (if doing no evil) though their glory, which is given for their works, be with held, or in other words their works are burned, not being profitable unto me. 3 Loosen ye one anothers hands, and up hold one another, that ye who are of the quorom of the Twelve, may all labor in the vineyard, for upon you rests much responsibility; and if ye labor diligently the time is soon when others shall be added unto your number till the quorum be full even twelve. 4 Be not hasty in ordaining men of the Negro race to offices in my Church, for verily I say unto you, all are not acceptable as servants, nevertheless I will that all may be saved, but every man in his own order, and there are some who are chosen instruments to be ministers to their own race, Be ye content, I, the Lord have spoken".

Thus saith the Spirit. 3 Let my servants William W. Blair and David H Smith, be chosen, and ordained to be counsellors to my servant, the presiding Elder of my church. Let them be set apart to this office by the laying on of hands by my servants whose duty it is to ordain and set in order the officers of my church; and let my servants, the President of the High Priests Quorom, and the president of the Lesser Priesthood, also lay their hands upon these their brethern who are to be counselors, but let my servants of the Twelve be the spokesmen. 4 Let my servants William H Kelley, Thomas W Smith, James Caffall, John H. Lake, Alexander H Smith, Zenas H Gurley, and Joseph R. Lambert, be chosen as especial witnesses, even as Quorom of the Twelve for they are called thereunto, that they may take this ministry upon them. Let them be ordained and set apart to this office by the laying on of the hands of my servants joseph Smith Jason W. Briggs and William W Blair. 5 Verily, I say unto you, if these my servants will hence forth magnify the ir calling in honor before me, they shall become men of power and excellent wisdom in the assemblies of my people. 6 Let the names of my servants Daniel B Rasey and Reuben Newkirk be taken from the record of the Quorom of Twelve, and placed with the records of the names of the Elders, and their labors will be accepted by me. 7 It is my will that my servant Jason W Briggs, Josiah Ells and Edmund C. Briggs, remain and stand in their lots as especial witnesses before me. Let them diligently labor in their ministry, encouraging and directing their brethern in their labors. It is expedient for the good of my cause that my servant Jason take the active oversight of his quorom. 8 Let my servant Archibald M Wilsey, William D Morton, and George Rarick, be ordained high priests; and let my servants R.C. Brand, Charles W. Wandell, and Duncan Campbell be appointed as special witnesses of the seventy in their places and let my servant Joseph La Keman, Glaud Rogers, John T Davies and John S. Patterson, be also appointed as witnesses of the seventy before me. 9 Until such time as the Quorom of Twelve shall be filled the decision of that Quorom, a unanimous decision, shall be accounted final, as if such quorom were filled, according to my law as given in the Book of Doctrine and Coveants. And until such time as the Quorom of Seventy shall be filled, their decision, if unanimous and agreeing with that of the quorom of Twelve, shall be considered that same as if the quorom were filled. 10 It is expedient that the Bishop of my church shall choose two Counsellors, and that they be ordained to their office as my law directs; that there may be henceforth no cavalling among my people. The Bishp of my Church may also choose and appoint Bishops agents until it shall be wisdom in me to ordain other Bishops, in the Districts and large branches of my church. 11 It is not expedient in me that there shall be any stakes appointed until I command my people. When it shall be necessary, I will command that they be established. Let my commandments to gather in to the region round about, and counsel of the Elders of my church guide in this matter until it shall otherwise be given of me. 12 Behold, if my servants and my handmaidens, of the different organizations for good among my people, shall continue in righteousness they

Thus saith the Lord, Amen". I also offer in evidence section one hundred and eighteen on page three hundred and forty two, as follows, - Revelation given September 28th 1882. Unto the Elders of my Church. 1 In asking of me ye did well. I will hasten my work in its time. Ye cannot now prosecute missions in many foreign lands, nor is it expedient that the Elders of the First Quoroms be sent out of the land of America until the work of the re-organization on my church be more fully established. And a greater unity of understanding between them by obtained. Nor is it expedient now to further fill up the Quoroms, except it be the elders, priests, teachers, and deacons; which ye may do as ye deem wise, by the direction of Conference. 2 Continue the mission in Chicago until April Conference, when if it be found expedient it may be left in charge of the authorities of the Northern Illinois District. 3 It is my will that ye may more fully honor and pay heed to the voice and counsel to the travelling ministery in spiritual things; which if ye do not, the office which they hold is not honored in my service, and the good they should do is made void. 4 If they approve themselves as righteous ministers, they shall be blest; if they be found transgressors or idle servants ye shall not uphold them. But be not hasty in drawing your support from them, peradventure ye shall injure my work. Even now I am not well pleased with some, but space is granted for repentance and a renewal of diligence. Let no one deceive himself, that he shall not account for his stewardsship unto me. Joseph Smith. By command of the Spirit". I also offer in evidence section one hundred and nineteen on page three hundred and forty three, as follows,- "Revelation given April 11th 1887". To the Elders of the Church, - Thus saith the Spirit, - 1 It is not yet expedient that the quorom of Twelve shall be filled; nevertheless, seperate my servants, James W Gillen, Heman C Smith, Joseph Luff and Gomer T Griffiths, unto the office of apostles that the quorom may be more perfectly prepared to ack before me. I have still other men of my church, who shall be designated in their time if they still continue faithful unto me and in the work whereunto they are now called. 2 There is a great work to be done by my ne elders, and that they may be fitted to do this work, and the accomplishment thereof be not prevented, it is enjoined upon them that they shall not only be kind of heart and of a lowly spirit, that their wisdom may be the wisdom of the Lord and their strength, the strength of the Spirit, but they shall lay aside lightness of speech and lightness of manner, when standing to declare the word, and shall study to approve their administrationa to the people by candor in speech and courtesy in demeanor, that as ministers of the gospel they may win souls to Christ.

    </pagenumber>3 The elders and men of the church should be of, cheerful heart and countenance among themselves, and in there intercourse with their neighbors and men of the world, yet they must be without blame in word and deed. It is therefore not seemingly that they indulge in loud and boisterous speech, or in the relating of coarse and vulgar stories, or those in which the names of God and their Redeemer are blasphemed. Men of God, who bear the vessels of the Lord, be ye clean in your bodies and in your clothing; let your garments be of a sober character, and free from excess of ornamentation. Avoid the use of tobacco and be not addicted to strong drink in any form, that your counsel to be temperate may be made effectual by your example. 4 That he work of restoration to which the people of my church are looking forward may be hastened in its time, the elders must cease to be over-careful concerning the return of those who were once of the faith, but were over come in the dark and cloudy day, fearing lest they should bring in hidden heresies to the overthrowing of the work; for verily there are some who are chosen vessels to do good, who have been estranged by the hindering snares, which are in the world, and who will in due time return unto the Lords if they be not hindered by the men of the church. The Spirit says "come", let not the ministers for Christ prevent their coming. 5 And the Spirit saith further; Contention is unseemingly, therefore cease to contend respecting the sacrament, and the time of administering, it, for whether it be on the first Lords Day of every month or upon the Lords Day of every week, if it be administered by the offices of the church with sincerity of heart, and in purity of purpose and be partaken of in remembrance of Jesus Christ, and in willingness, to take upon them his name by them who partake, it is acceptable to God to avoid confusion, let him who presides in the sacrament meeting and those who administer it cause that the emblems be duly prepared upon clean vessels for the bread, and clean vessels for the wine, or the water as my be expedient; and the officer may break the bread before it is blessed and pour the wine before it is blessed; or he may, if he be so led, bless the bread before it be broken and the wine before it is poured; nevertheless both bread and wine should be uncovered when presented for the blessings to be asked upon it. It is expedient that the bread and wine should be administered in the early part of the meeting before weariness and confusion ensue. Let him that partaketh and him that refraineth cease to contend with his brother that each may be benefited when he eateth at the table of the Lord. 6 The service of song in the house of the Lord with humility and unity of Spirit in them that sing and them that hear is blessed and acceptable with God; but song in grievous sadness in them that sing and bitterness of spirit in them that hear is not pleasing to God Therefore, in all the congregation of the people of God, let all strife and contention concerning song service cease; and that the worship in the house of the Lord my be complete and wholly acceptable, let them who shall be moved thereto by a desire and the gift to sing, take upon them the burden and care of the service, and use therein instruments of music of the reed and of the string or instruments of brass in congregations that are large, and as wisdom and choice may direct. Let the young men, and the maidens cultivate the gifts of music and of song; let not the middle aged and the old forget the gladsomeness of their youth and let them aid and assist so far as their care will permit; and remember that the saints should be cheerful in their warfare that they may be joyous in their triumph. Nevertheless let the organ and the stringed instrument, and the instrument of brass be silent when the Saints assemble

    </pagenumber>for prayer and testimony, that the feelings of the tender and the sad may not be intruded upon. To facilitate unity in the service of the church, those to whom the work of providing a book of song has been entrusted, may hasten their work in this time. 7. And the Spirit saith further; Inasmuch as there has been much discussion in the past concerning the sabbath of the Lord, the church is admonished, and that until further revelation is received, or the quorums of the church are assembled to decide concerning the law in the church articles and covenants, the saints are to observe the first day of the week commonly called the Lord's day, as a day of rest; as a day of worship, as given in the covenants and commandments. And on this day they should refrain from unnecessary work; nevertheless nothing should be permitted to go to waste on that day, not should necessary work be neglected. Be not harsh in judgement but merciful in this, as in all other things. Be not hypocrites, not of those who make a man an offender for a word. 8. Prosecute the missionary work in this land and abroad so far and so widely as you may. All are called according to the gifts of God unto them; and to the intent that all may labor together, let him that laboreth in the ministry and him that toileth in the affairs of men of business and of work labor together with God for the accomplishment of the work entrusted to all. 9. Be clean, be frugal, cease to complain of pain and sickness and distress of body; take sleep in the hours set apart by God for the rebuilding and strengthening of the body and mind; for even now there are some, even among the elders, who are suffering body and mind, who have disregarded the advice of the Spirit, to retire early and rise early that vigor of mind and body shall be retained. Bear the burdens of body of which the Spirit of healing from the Lord in faith, or the use of that which wisdom directs does not relieve or remove and in cheerfulness do whatever may be permitted you to perform, that the blessing of peace may be upon you all. Amen. Kirtland, Ohio. April 11th, 1887."

  <question>Now my object in offering these sections from exhibit J, is for the purpose of showing on your cross examination that the doctrine at present taught and practiced by the reorganized church has been added to large since the year 1860. That is my object in putting these in evidence, and I will ask you now Mr. Smith if that is not the case?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Kelley, "That question is objected to on the ground that it does not call for the best evidence of the fact as it calls for an opinion of the witness, and is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial and not cross examination, and the introduction of the sections or pages from Exhibit J, just put in evidence is objected to for the same reason". By Mr. Southern,</mono>

  <question>What is you answer to the question?</question>

  <questionnumber>871</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not in that revelation make a deliverance to that effect, —"Be not hasty in ordaining men of the Negro race to office in my church"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, —"I object to that, and I wish you would not answer Mr Smith until I propound my question. That is not the best evidence, —the question is not the best evidence, —the best evidence is in the hands of the counsel propounding the question. " By Mr Southern, —</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>872</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you make that deliverance in that revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>873</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not make a deliverance of this kind also, which is accepted by the re—organized church, —"Until such time as the Quorom of Twelve shall be filled an unanimous decision shall be accounted final as if such quoroms were filled according to my law as given in the book of doctrine and covenants, and until such time as the Quorom of Seventy shall be filled their decision, if unanimous, and agreeing with that of the Quorom of Twelve, shall be considered the same as if the quorom were filled". Now sir is that not the law of the re—organized church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it is. It is, but it is direct harmony with the fundamental law of the church regarding those organizations.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, —"That question is objected to for the reason that it is irrelevant and immeterial, and calls for an opinion of the witness, is leading and is not cross examination, and the answer is objected to for the same reasons and motion made to strike it out for the same reasons.

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial and does not call for the best evidence, and is not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>875</questionnumber>
  <question>You also delivered that utterance?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir and it is in direct harmony with the teachings of the book it has referred to</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>876</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there any authority in the old organization for a direct organization?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I believe there was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>877</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you point it out? I will permit you to do it at any time if you cannot find it now?</question>
  <answer>How is that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>878</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if you could point it out, and said that if you could not do it, I would permit you to do it at any time?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I could specifically. It is a matter of the organization, and the word district is used in distinguishing conferences or organized branches, —the one from the other.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>879</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the way that is?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it is possible that the term is used with that understanding. In the organic law the declaration is made that the elders shall meet in conference once in three months, or from time to time to do the business that is to be done, —what—ever it may bee, —at the time and in the manner that the conference shall appoint. It is also the duty of the branches to send a list of their membership who last joined, or who were disqualified, —or rather I should say dis—fellowshipped,"</answer>

  <questionnumber>882</questionnumber>
  <question>Does not the law to which you refer say it shall be an elders conference?</question>
  <answer>It says the several elders shall hold a conference. It says also that the branches shall send some officers or teacher, or the hand of some priests their report.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>883</questionnumber>
  <question>Is this not the law of the re-organized church as given through you by revelation, - "Presidents of the seventy are instructed to select from their several quoroms of elders, such as are qualified and in a condition to take upon them the office of Seventy".</question>
  <answer>Where is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>884</questionnumber>
  <question>That is found on page three hundred and fifty, paragraph ten in Exhibit J?</question>
  <answer>I hold exhibit J here in my hand and page three hundred and forty six is the last page in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>885</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will withdraw that question because I have inadvertently gone further than the exhibit exhibit extends. Is this an added law of the church on page three hundred and forty four in section one hundred and nineteen, - the last one I quoted from there, beginning one line from the top at the words "Men of God who bear the vessels of the Lord, be ye clean in your bodies and in your clothing. Let your garments be of a sober character and free from excessive ornamentation Avoid the use of tobacco and be not addicted to strong drink in any form, that your counsel to be temperate may be made effective by your example"?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, calling for an opinion of the witness, and not cross examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>886</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that an addition to the former rule of the church?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the same reasons as are set forth in the objection to the last preceeding question.</mono>
  <answer>It is a matter of instruction and amplification. I do not think it is an addition by simply an elucidation in the way of instruction.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>887</questionnumber>
  <question>Well so far as I am individually concerned and my sentiments are concerned that is a very good rule and one to be applauded; but for the purposes of this case I have quoted it here, and asked you to answer it?</question>
  <answer>Well I have to the best of my ability. It is merely a matter of instruction, and it is also in harmony with the revelation to be found in the first book of covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>888</questionnumber>
  <question>Does the revelation in the first book of covenants, to which you refer, prohibit the use of tobacco entirely?</question>
  <answer>No sir not entirely. It is called a word of wisdom by way of instruction and not by way of constraint, for you can use it for sick cattle, and for bruises.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>889</questionnumber>
  <question>But does it not permit the use of a small amount for a man.</question>
  <answer>I think not, - not to chew or smoke I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>890</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your recollection?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. It is not an imperative command.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>891</questionnumber>
  <question>Does this law to which you refer have anything to say about the use of ornamentation for the person?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it says let your ornamentation be the work of your own hands. It says that it should be the workmanship of your own hands, but does limit the amount, - leaving that to the individual taste.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>892</questionnumber>
  <question>Is the word "ornament" used?</question>
  <answer>I think it is "ornamentation, " but it may not be it may be "embellishment".</answer>

  <questionnumber>893</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr. Smith in the examination of this question of doctrine, or I should say this question of the doctrine of the revelation, I conceive it to be necessary in the examination of the doctrine of revelation as it has been presented here to ask you how these revelations from God are received?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Kelley, "Hold on don't answer until I get through with the objection. I object to that question in the first place because it is improper examination, it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial and is a matter that does not have the slightest connection to the question at issue in this case either directly or indirectly." By My Southern,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>894</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you may proceed to answer that question?</question>
  <answer>Revelation as I understood, or understand it are received in different ways. Sometimes by impression, sometimes by the person becoming conscious of it, and sometimes by an audible voice heard by the individual by whom the revelation is received, and sometimes by a direct messenger, and sometimes by what we understand to be the intervention of the Spirit.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>895</questionnumber>
  <question>How is that men when he becomes conscious of a thought or inspiration, that it is received from without, whether it is a revelation from without or a suggestion from within?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that the same is irrelevant and immeterial and incompetent, is not proper cross examination, and calls for an option of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>Well it is pretty difficult to tell.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>896</questionnumber>
  <question>What is that?</question>
  <answer>I said it was probably difficult to tell. Each person who receives a revelation would have to judge as to that himself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>897</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a matter of his own judgement as to whether or not it is a suggestion from without or one from within?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not at times.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>898</questionnumber>
  <question>There are exceptions to that rule then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, as there is to all rules there is exceptions I suppose to this. Now when a man hears a voice he knows he hears it, and so that must be a suggestion as you call it, from without.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>899</questionnumber>
  <question>How does a man know when he hears a voice from without that is the voice of God, and not the voice of some other, a voice from some human source?</question>
  <answer>I don't know how the man would tell in every instance.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>900</questionnumber>
  <question>How could he tell in any instance?</question>
  <answer>It would be according to the surroundings and conditions.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>901</questionnumber>
  <question>Then as a matter of fact it is a matter of judgement with him as to whether or not it is the voice of God he hears, or a voice of some other character?</question>
  <answer>He must base his own action on what he hears, it must be on his judgement as a matter of fact. As a matter of course it must be based on his judgement, for that is all he has to guide him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>902</questionnumber>
  <question>Then when a revelation is received from some direct agency as you suggest, how can the recipient tell you that that voice is from God or some other source?</question>
  <answer>He will have to decide from the circumstances under which that communication was received. He will have to decide as to its intent, and objects of course, and so far as we are concerned by its relation to what we have already received and accepted as the word of God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>903</questionnumber>
  <question>
    So the ultimate outcome of the whole matter is that the man's own best judgement is the guide or judge as to whether or not

    </pagenumber>a revelation when received comes from within or without or whether it is the word of God? The whole thing rests on his own best judgement after all?
  </question>
  <answer>No sir I do not so understand it. If any body says anything to me I understand that they say it, and if I hear what they say clearly, and apprehend it, it is not a matter of my judgement as to whether I accept it or not. I am forced to accept it and my judgement as to whether or not I heard the thing is not called into requisition for it is a matter that is not involved in doubt at all . Whether I accept it depends on circumstances such as whether there is a reason for it or occasion for it, or whether it comports with what he has already said upon the same subject if he has said anything to my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>904</questionnumber>
  <question>May not a man, though in the Presidency of the church, be mistaken as to these matters?</question>
  <answer>What matters?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>905</questionnumber>
  <question>As to the genuineness or authenticity of revelations he purports to have received?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>906</questionnumber>
  <question>Then is it not a fact that these revelations are not accepted by the church, - by the re-organized church of Latter Day Saints until they have been adopted by the Assemblies and approved by the quoroms?</question>
  <answer>I hardly think that I apprehend that questions Colonel?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>907</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if these revelations, laws and rules of the church or what purport to be laws and rules of the church reveled through the instrumentality of revelations, - are they regarded as revelations or laws or rules or action to the church of which you are the President now, until they have been formally adopted by the church as such?</question>
  <answer>No sir they are not binding, - they are subject to consideration and examination.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>908</questionnumber>
  <question>But they do be come laws of the church, when they are accepted by the church as such?</question>
  <answer>When they are accepted by the church they become binding upo it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>909</questionnumber>
  <question>Then is it not the law of the church, - of the re-organized church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints that new revelations may be given, and they may be accepted by the church, and thereby become laws of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, not cross examination, and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>910</questionnumber>
  <question>That can be done?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that is done. Under our declaration of faith we believe that God has revealed himself in times past, that He does reveal Himself and will continue to reveal Himself to men upon this earth whenever such revelations are needed according to His divine judgement. We believe this for we know it to be so, and we therefore look for further revelations in the future at such time and places and through such instrumentality as He sees fit to make the medium of His communication to this earth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>911</questionnumber>
  <question>Then is it not a fact that the church that existed from 1830 up to the time of the disruption of 1846 or 1847, had none of these subsequent revelations as its law?</question>
  <answer>Of course they did not have any that were given subsequent to that time, nor those given to the re-organized church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>912</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it really a fact that the church from 1830 to 1834 had the same rules of doctrine as are to be found and set forth in the 1835 edition of the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>I could not tell you that.</answer>

  </question>
  <answer>I think so, if they were received and accepted by the same body.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>914</questionnumber>
  <question>Could that body have been governed by laws that were passed afterwards?</question>
  <answer>At that time?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>915</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>No sir. It could not be governed by the law prior to the time of the passage of the law. That is a self evident fact I think. It would be like attempting to govern a territorial community under a state law, that is something that could not very well be done, for at that time, or prior to that time the church was in what might be called its formative period, for the laws were being revealed and formulated by which it was to be afterwards governed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>916</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that law is only enforced after it is enacted?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent and immaterial and for the additional reason that the question calls for a legal conclusion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir, I so understand that to be the fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>917</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is that not the fact with a law of the church?</question>
  <answer>We may receive a revelation and act upon it, and the matter afterwards be submitted to the body authorized to pass upon the revelation, and it would be sanctioned. That has been done in the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>918</questionnumber>
  <question>Well would you be willing to state upon your oath that the church prior to 1834 acted upon revelations that were received subsequent to that date?</question>
  <answer>I would not like to swear to that, or even make a statement regarding that condition upon my own judgement.</answer>

  <question>Well no, I wouldn't think you would?</question>

    My answer is that so far as my knowledge goes the reorganized church has paid money out on account of that temple lot and today

  <question>Well I did not so understand it from your reading?</question>
  <answer>Well yes sir I believe it is but one. The two ordinations took place however at the same time, but they are reported as one. I was ordained first as high priest and then President of the high priest hood subsequently.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>996</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the minutes don't show the ordination as presiding high priest of the priesthood do they? Do they show that?</question>

    </pagenumber>hood without their first being an ordination to the priest hood. Is that not a fact that there could not be an ordination to the Presidency of the high priest hood without there first being an ordination to the high priest hood?
  </question>
  <answer>I hardly think it would be proper, but in this case I know that I was ordained an high priest. There is no manner of doubt of that, and afterwards ordained to the Presidency. I know that as well as I know anything that ever happened in my experience.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1005</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there a motion made, and a vote taken, on that motion to ordain you a high priest at that conference?</question>
  <answer>I couldn't say whether there was or not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1006</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was there or was there not?</question>
  <answer>I say that I cannot say. My impression is that there was, but I cold not say positively whether there was nor not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1007</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you chosen after your ordination as a high priest, from among the high priest hood, to be ordained the presiding high priest of the high priest hood?</question>
  <answer>I would not say that I was with that formula.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1008</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recognize what I am not going to read from Exhibit J, one page two ninty one, paragraph eleven as a law of the church on this subject, - "Of necessity, there are presidents or presiding officers, growing out of, or appointed of, or from among those who are ordained to the several offices in these two priest hoods. Of the Melchisedeck priest hood, three presiding high priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to the office, and upheld by the confidence, faith and prayer of the church, form a quorom of the Presidency of the church". Do you recognize that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1009</questionnumber>
  <question>As what do you recognize?</question>
  <answer>I recognize it as a rule for the government of the church?</answer>

  <question>A rule for the government of the church? Is that what you said?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is what I said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1011</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recognize this also as the law in paragraph thirty one on page two hundred and ninety four of Exhibit J, - "Wherefore it must needs be that one be appointed of the high priest hood to preside over the priest hood; and he shall be called President of the high priest hood of the church. From the same comes the administering or ordinances and blessings upon the church, by the laying on of hands". Do you recognize that as a law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1012</questionnumber>
  <question>
    And this also on page two hundred and ninety seven of the same Exhibit, which reads as follows, "And again, the duty of the President of the office of the high priest hood, is to preside over the whole church and to be like unto Moses. Behold here is wisdom, yea, to be a seer, a revelator, a translator and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows on the head of the church".

  <questionnumber>1020</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you understand the question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I simply understand it to mean the possession of the right of authority. There is a controversy among the people as to what the "keys" do mean. The right to act properly is my understanding of it.</answer>

  <question>That is your understanding of it?</question>

  </question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question on the same grounds</mono>
  <answer>Do you ask that as a question, or make it as an assertion?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1027</questionnumber>
  <question>Well never mind, - let that pass, - Now Mr Smith have you the Jaredite interpreters?</question>
  <answer>I have not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1028</questionnumber>
  <question>Then I am prompted to ask you this question Mr Smith. How can you be a seer without these things?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and for the further reasons that it is improper cross examination, and calls for an expression of opinion from the witness.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1029</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you answer that question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir but my answer would be merely an expression, and that would hardly have any value in a court of equity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1030</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you may answer it in your own way?</question>
  <answer>A seer may exercise the privelege or provine of seeing by virtue or inherent quality. That may belong to any person, as is proven by the many instances we have of that power or gift.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1031</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recognize what I am now about to read from the book of Mormon, chapter five, paragraph ten of the book of Mosiah, as follows, - "Now Ammon said unto Him, I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith he can look and translate all the records that are of ancient date, and is a gift from God. And the things are called interpreters; and not man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not, and he should perish. And whoso is commanded to look in them the same is called seer. And behold the people who is in the land of Zarahemla, is the man that is commanded to do these things, and who has this high gift from God. And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet. And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God which no man can; yet a man may have great power, given him from God. But a seer can know of things which are passed, and also of things which are to come; and by them shall all things be revealed, or rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, which otherwise could not be known. Thus God has provided a means, that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings". I ask you now if you recognize that as a law of the church with reference to the office you have just testified you held?</question>
  <answer>We regard it precisely as it purports to be, and for what it purports to be, - the statements made by two persons, - one the king and the other a man called Ammon giving his statement in regard to it. It is merely a matter of instruction to us.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1032</questionnumber>
  <question>Are those statements which I have just read regarded as true by your church?</question>
  <answer>I could not say any further than I have stated, - we regard them as the statements of individuals purporting to make the statements as they appear in the book itself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1033</questionnumber>
  <question>Does your church look upon these as revelations?</question>
  <answer>They look upon the whole book as a revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1034</questionnumber>
  <question>Including the part that I have read?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, the whole book, including what you have read.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1035</questionnumber>
  <question>What did you say it was, - the part I have read?</question>
  <answer>It is just what it purports to be a narration of what was said by these two people at that time, - the king and Ammon.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1036</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then have you ever exercised the duties of a seer?</question>
  <answer>No not by the interpreter, for I have never been called upon to do it, I have never been commanded to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1037</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you be a seer without the commandments?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it calls for an opinion of the witness, is not cross examination, and is incompetent and irrelevant.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1038</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you be a seer without the commandments is the question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir a man can be a seer and cannot exercise the office or gift except by commandment.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1039</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you state that since you have been President of the re-organized church of Latter Day Saints, there has been no necessity for the exercise of that function?</question>
  <answer>I will not say as I do not know whether there has been or has not been any necessity for it. I am not the one to determine as to the character of the necessity.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness and moves the court to strike out the answer on the grounds that the question to which it is a reply is incompetent and immeterial, is not cross examination, and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1040</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you have stated repeatedly in this cross examination, when asked concerning these matters, or when asked concerning matters that you did not have any knowledge concerning, that you did not know?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1041</questionnumber>
  <question>You have said that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I have said that when asked concerning matters of which I did not have any personal cognizance.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1042</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if your are a seer, and holding that office, why do you make that kind of an answer?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground, and for the reason that the same is incompetent calls for an opinion of the witness, and is not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Simply because the matter spoken of had never been brought to my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1043</questionnumber>
  <question>And therefor you are not prepared to answer, is that it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. What is or has been brought to my knowledge or comprehension in any way, that matter I am prepared to make a statement regarding it, but not otherwise.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1044</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe from your testimony you stated that you have been President of the Re-organized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for about thirty years?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, a little over thirty years, - since April 1860.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1045</questionnumber>
  <question>And in all that time these questions pertaining to the functions of a seer have never been raised have they?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, is not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>The question has been raised and discussed frequently so far as my experience goes by a great many, but I have never taken any special part in the discussion.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1046</questionnumber>
  <question>Do I understand you to say that you have never exercised the functions of a seer?</question>
  <answer>Not with these interpreters as you read from the book.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1047</questionnumber>
  <question>Why haven't you exercised the functions if you are a seer?</question>
  <answer>Simply because I have never been commanded so to do., and never had the articles in my possession to use them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1048</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Mr Smith were you called by revelation to the office of seer?

  </question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness</mono>
  <answer>I could not tell you that I was subject to my own counsciousness. I can state as to what I felt, but what others thought about it I cannot say. What others may have done, or what it was to others I cannot say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1049</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe you testified that you were ordained by your father to have and hold all the functions which he, your father, held?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1050</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I did not so state it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1051</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not, and that you testify to?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that is what I say. I did not so state it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1052</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were you ordained as your fathers successor in all things?</question>
  <answer>I was not ordained by my father.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1053</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how was it?</question>
  <answer>According to my understanding of the meaning of the word "ordained", I was not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1054</questionnumber>
  <question>You were not ordained by your father?</question>
  <answer>No sir I was blessed by him and designated, - well in a sense chosen, and the word ordained could not be applied in any other sense than by the act of pointing out or indicating only, and he indicated or designated me as his successor.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1055</questionnumber>
  <question>You said that you were blessed by your father, - were you called through that means or by that blessing?</question>
  <answer>I do not know that significance you might attach to the word "call", but I understood it at the time, and understand it now to have been a blessing he conferred upon me in the event of a necessity therefore, and by the act conferring certain priveleges upon me, or to designate me to do certain work, - depending as I understood it then, and understand it now, upon good behavior, and upon any subsequent call I might receive.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1056</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recognize yourself as the successor of one mighty and strong, as revealed in the revelation to your father?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that it is not proper cross-examination, is incompetent and immeterial, and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>I cannot answer that question sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1057</questionnumber>
  <question>Why cannot you answer it?</question>
  <answer>I have already said why. I have already stated why I cannot answer it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1058</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you not claimed the office which you now hold as from, - or rather as a succession from your father, and that you have a right by lineal descent to it?</question>
  <answer>I claim to be his successor by lineal right, and by his blessing, and lastly by the right of selection and appointment.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1059</questionnumber>
  <question>By right of appointment you also claim it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1060</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it a birth right then, to be the President of the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not necessarily.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1061</questionnumber>
  <question>How does that come then?</question>
  <answer>It comes by virtue of fitness and qualification, - I might say good behaviour and the choice of the people, recognizing a call, or a right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1062</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr Smith does lineal right assume these qualifications?</question>
  <answer>Not necessarily.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1063</questionnumber>
  <question>And did it in your case?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say. That is a matter I apprehend to be proven.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1064</questionnumber>
  <question>Was the doctrine of lineal right a doctrine of your church prior to the death of your father?</question>

    </pagenumber>open to the inspection of all. I know that there is a kind of traditional teaching to that effect there.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1065</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it a lineal right in your church?</question>
  <answer>Nothing further than what is found in the books based on tradition. The right of th firstborn is found in the Book of Mormon and also in the Bible.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1066</questionnumber>
  <question>What right is that?</question>
  <answer>The traditional right of the firstborn to whatever may attach to the parent.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1067</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that right expressed or understood in such a way that your office or whatever rights you hold by virtue of your office, or whatever powers you hold or are gifted with by reason of the position you hold, would descend to your eldest son?</question>
  <answer>I will answer that by saying yes, with the qualification that all other things are equal. The same attaches to the firstborn of every family to whatever may appertain to the sire.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1068</questionnumber>
  <question>What other claim is there, if any, of the reorganized church which existed up to the time of your father's death, if it be not a lineal claim through you as the successor of your father?</question>
  <answer>It is the claim of the individuals who were members of the church at his death, and hold their membership, and their rights to be regarded as members of the body in the reorganized church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1069</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you regard your lineal successorship as one of the claims?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not necessariy in the reorganized church. The existence of the reorganized church does not depend on my lineal successorship as I understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1070</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe you stated that you have not seen the records of the church that were kept from 1830 down to 1844?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir, along towards the latter times of the chruch there at Nauvoo there was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1079</questionnumber>
  <question>What were the functions of that office?</question>
  <answer>The office of Patriarch?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1080</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes, sir.</question>
  <answer>As I undersand it, he was an evangelical minister, a kind of a local Patriarch.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1081</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there such an office in the reorganized church?</question>
  <answer>No, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1082</questionnumber>
  <question>There is no such an office in the reorganized church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, we have no Patriarch. There is a provision in the organic law of the church for the office, but we have no Patriarch ordained.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1083</questionnumber>
  <question>Is the right to that office a lineal right or not?</question>

  <questionnumber>1085</questionnumber>
  <question>Of all who are officers of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Everybody. Every family. Whatever right belongs to or pertains to the sire descends to the son, all other things being equal. It is not a right that must be enforced, for it may never be exercised or it may be held in abeyance.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1086</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that a rule in the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>That is a traditional rule if the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1087</questionnumber>
  <question>It is laid down in the teachings of the books of the church?</question>
  <answer>Nothing more than what appears in the bible and the book of Mormon, and it also appears in the book of covenants.</answer>

  <question>Was there such a book in the old church?</question>
  <answer>I have in my library Jefferson's Manual that was used by the parliamentary people of the church.</answer>

  <question>Nod did you get that book?</question>
  <answer>It was in my fathers library, and came to me in that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1094</questionnumber>
  <question>But your book of rules is not Jefferson's Manual?</question>
  <answer>No sir. It is a book that was compiled by the authority of a committee of the conference, and appointed by the conference for the purpose of compiling a book to govern in debates, public meetings, etc., and when the book was compiled it was accepted by the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1095</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you a school for the prophets in the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it is not so designated.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1096</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there such a school in the church prior to the death of your father?</question>
  <answer>I understood or understand there was at Kirtland but I cannot say whether there was one in Nauvoo or not. I cannot testify to that as these things are a matter of history, and that is where I get my information.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1097</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you any means of determining whether the system represented in the higher grades of the church are the same in the re-organized church as were in existence in the old church before it was dissolved?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't know that I have.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1098</questionnumber>
  <question>You haven't sufficient knowledge to state whether that was the fact or not?</question>

  <answer>Yes that is what I understand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1106</questionnumber>
  <question>Is their work not of primary importance to the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir as spiritual ministers they are. I might say that they were the leading quorom in the church, and their work was of necessity of great importance to the church and its welfare. So far as the work of preaching was concerned they constituted the leading quorom in the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1107</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that the twelve, or nearly all of the twelve that constituted the quorom of twelve at the time of your fathers death, afterwards went with Brigham Young to Salt Lake City?</question>

  <question>Do you know how many of them went with Brigham Young to Salt Lake City?</question>
  <answer>I believe nine of them did.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent and immeterial, and not the best evidence nor proper cross examination and calling for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>The history states that there was a number appointed of the new organization.

  <question>It was since 1852?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and it may have been at that conference of 1852.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1113</questionnumber>
  <question>What right have you to do that if the oldest son succeeds to the functions of the father, ad nine of the twelve apostles went to Salt Lake?</question>
  <answer>Well sir we had the right simply because the conditions had changed and were not equal. The right of the son to succeed to the office or function of the father or sire, doe snot depend upon his lineal descent alone, - it it has a co-dependence that is the fitness and moral qualification of the son to succeed the sire. In this case other things besides the question of lineal descent were not equal.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1114</questionnumber>
  <question>Other things were not equal?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1115</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the matter, wherein were not other things equal?</question>
  <answer>The ones that went west to Salt Lake Valley were preaching and openly proclaiming and practicing a doctrine entirely contrary to the fundamental principles of the church, and all its teachings, and they who re-organized one church in 1852 repudiated that doctrine and it is not likely that in the re-organization they would ordain the sons of men who were preaching a false and pernicious doctrine. 1115 (Second 1115)</answer>
  <question>By what right did they assume to do that?</question>
  <answer>
    By the inherent right of man hood and humanity to assert their opinions and defend their principles and rights. That was the right sir and the people who met together in 1852 and re-organized the church asserted that right by maintaining, or rather re-establishing the church in its purity.

  <question>That is their duty?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1105</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was their duty in the old church prior to the death of your father?</question>
  <answer>Yes. That is what I understand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1106</questionnumber>
  <question>Is their work not of primary importance in the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir as spiritual ministers they are. I might say that they were the leading quorum in the church, and their work was of necessity of great importance to the church and its welfare. So far as the work of preaching was concerned they constituted the leading quorum in the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1107</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that the twelve, or nearly all of the twelve that constituted the quorum of twelve at the time of your father's death, afterwards went with Brigham Young to Salk Lake City?</question>
  <answer>I believe they did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1108</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know how many of them went with Brigham Young to Salk Lake City?</question>
  <answer>I believe nine of them did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1109</questionnumber>
  <question>Then Mr. Smith, if nine of the twelve went to Salt Lake City, with that part of the organization that went to Utah, and the eldest son of the officers in the church are entitled to the succession, how would it be possible for you to ever get a twelve in the re-organized church?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is in competent and immaterial, and not the best evidence nor proper cross examination and calling for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>The history states that there was a number appointed of the new organization. Now I am only stating what history states was done, and when this was done seven were chosen from among the people, or the elders or ministers present and they were chosen and set apart to act in the apostolic office.</answer>

  <question>What as the matter, wherein were not other things equal?</question>
  <answer>The ones that went west to Salk Lake Valley were preaching and openly proclaiming and practicing a doctrine entirely contrary to the fundamental principles of the church, and all it's teachings, and they who re-organized the church in 1852 repudiated that doctrine and it is not likely that in the reorganization they would ordain the sons of men who were preaching a false and pernicious doctrine.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1116</questionnumber>
  <question>By what right did they assume to do that?</question>
  <answer>By the inherent right of manhood and humanity to assert their opinions and defend their principles and rights. That was the right sire and the people who met together in 1852 and reorganized the church asserted that right by maintaining. or rather re-establishing the church in its purity.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1116</questionnumber>
  <question>So their right did not come from ecclesiasticism?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir they had the ecclesiastic right the same as they always had. Their hope of salvation depended on the proper and pure exercises of these functions, and they are responsible to God and not to man for the way in which they exercise the gift that God had given them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1117</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that an assumed law, - a law that they made unto themselves or is it found in your standard authorities?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it is to be found in the books.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1118</questionnumber>
  <question>What books of authority is it to be found in?</question>
  <answer>it is to be found in the bible, the book of Mormon, and in the book of covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1119</questionnumber>
  <question>I would be glad if you would point it out to me?</question>
  <answer>You would?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1120</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well I can do it. "he that loveth me keepeth my commandments, and the same is my deciple", and also the statement of our Saviour to John, "if you continue in my doctrine, then are you my desciples indeed", and he also says ye shall knw the truth, and the truth shall make you free". Now I do not know that I can answer that question any better than I have done, for there is the fundamental principle in at under lies the whole structure of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1121</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I understand that, and I think it is the truth and very fine gospel, but what I want to asertain is who it is in your church who is delegated with the power to pass upon the fact as to whether or not a man has comported himself according to the law and the rules of the church? Who is entitles to be a judge. Where is the law that makes you a judge over your fellow man. I might quote some scripture too if I wanted too in that connection but I will not do so, but nevertheless I would like to know who consituted a judge to sin in judgement on your fellow man, and cast him out of the church?</question>
  <answer>These people who went to Utah were addicted before they went to the practice of polygamy, and continued to practice after they go t there to a certain extent still, and that is something that is forbidden, in the books that are authority in the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1122</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now what, - that is simply your opinion?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I know it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1123</questionnumber>
  <question>Why is it that John Taylor's opinion and judgement, for instance, not as sound as is your opinion and judgement?</question>
  <answer>So far as his judgement is concerned it may be as sound and legal as mine concerning his own deportment, but when John Taylor or any other man presumes to preach and practice a doctrine contrary to the teachings of the books of the church, or the books that the church as authorized and recognized as authority, it is the right of everybody, either individually or collectively to say whether or not they shall follow his example or associate with him, or whoever preaches these doctrines that are forbidden and condemned by the church in its authorized books of doctrine and practice.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1124</questionnumber>
  <question>Did every individual have a right to pass upon it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir every individual who retained his self respect and integrity according to his judgement had the right to pass upon it, and repudiate it if he felt so inclined, and this is just what the re-organized church did do collectively, what the individual had the right to do by himself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1125</questionnumber>
  <question>Ma it not have been the judgement of these who went to Salt Lake that they maintained their integrity by the course they took</question>

  <answer>Well now you are asking me to pass upon their motives or judgement and that is something I cannot do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1126</questionnumber>
  <question>So there has been no arbiter between you and them, - is that not a fact?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1127</questionnumber>
  <question>Nothing at all?</question>
  <answer>Nothing but the book, - the commandments, and the law as we found it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1128</questionnumber>
  <question>And as a matter of fact the issue between you and them has never been adjudicated has it?</question>
  <answer>In what way?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1129</questionnumber>
  <question>Well say ecclesiastically adjudicated?</question>
  <answer>No sir. There has been no competent ecclesiastical tribunal before which the question of he-say and orthodoxy could be tried this side of the judgement seat of Christ, but there are standards among men, especially among the Latter Day Saints which are equivalent to them at least, to the judgement of Christ. . We have the standards and the guides which are laid down as rules of action in the lives of men, and men, and when men go contrary to that we have the right and every man has the right to refuse to follow the false teachers and leaders, and to denounce their actions and teachings.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1130</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that when one man has a right to dix his standards of faction, that another man has the same right?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1131</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that more of the people who had adhered to the church of which your father was the President during his life time, went off with those nine apostles, than remained and were afterwards re-organized into the church of which you are now the President?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is improper cross examination, and calls for an opinion of the witness, and not for the best evidence, and is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial to any of the issues in this case.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1132</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that not a fact?</question>
  <answer>I don't understand the question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1133</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if it is not a fact that more of the people who adhered to the church during the time that your father was its President went off to the Salt Lake Valley with the faction that went there with the nine apostles, than there was remained behind and afterwards united with the church of which you are now the President?</question>
  <answer>That is a fact which I am not competent to answer positively. I will say that it may be the fact that more went off than afterwards came into the re-organized church, but I think there was more remained behind than went to the Valley. I can however give you some data if you choose to accept it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1134</questionnumber>
  <question>Well let us have it I will not object?</question>
  <answer>
    At the time of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith there was something like one hundred and fifty thousand or two hundred thousand members of the church here in America and Europe and the Islands of the Sea, and there was at Nauvoo and the stake adjacent something like twenty five thousand. Now that was the number there was then and in 1850 there was something like fifty thousand there in Utah, and the census of 1880 gives us some thing like one hundred and forty three thousand as belonging to the entire Utah church that apostatized. Under this showing there is a question as to whether or not there was not more who did not go west, but who remained behind and became scattered to the four quarters of the globe. I know that we have not held all who remained behind and did not go to Utah united with us. There is a very great many who did not unite with us, and a very great many who have gone off with different factions, and others again who have not united with any faction

  <question>You may read it?</question>
  <answer>"In conclusion on this point we shall readily cheerfully adopt as its corporate title "The Church of Christ", when a command to that effect comes through Gods authorized prophet and seer to his church. Gods church is one of order and authority, and he is wise who heeds this fact, and profits by it. Private interpretation of Scripture, like private notions of church government are neither consistent nor scriptural. "If he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man" and a publican". Matthew 18; 17."</answer>

  <question>Was that statement there of which I have just read of Joseph Smith about the revelation on April 26th 1838, where it says "Joseph the Seer received a revelation, saying", is that true?</question>
  <answer>It is true according to the record relied on.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1183</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>I mean that it is true as to the record it was cited from. it is a true citation from the record, but as to the correctness of the history we do not know anything about that, not do we endorse the history or say anything about its correctness.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1184</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you not recognize this quotation as a revelation, "Verily thus saith the Lord. My church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints scattered abroad in all the world, for thus shall it be called in the last days". Do you or do you not recognize that as a revelation?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, not proper cross examination and calling for an opinion of the witness only.</mono>
  <answer>I have stated already that I did not know of any such a revelation and I could not vouch for its correctness as a revelation, but I can vouch for its correctness as taken or copied from the record that it purports to have been taken from. That is all I can do, for I do not know that it was ever received, approved and adopted by the church according to the rules of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1185</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr Smith do you recognize this editorial upon that quotation, - "In order that the reader may see the timelines of this revelation he should remember that these were trying times for the church, for some of her strong ones were turning away to the beggarly elements, following their own private notions and seeking to justify themselves therein by wrestling and perverting texts of scriptures to suit their theories, prominent among them, the name of the church". Do you recognize that as editorial comment on the question?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, is not cross examination and calling for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir that is the statement made by the editor or write of that paragraph at the time, but it doe snot endorse however, the fact of their having a revelation, - neither as to the knowledge of the fact as to whether or not there was a revelation, nor as to correctness of the history.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1186</questionnumber>
  <question>You were one of the editors at the time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1187</questionnumber>
  <question>And you endorse what the editor did, just the same as if you had done it yourself?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. In this way, - I stand associated with him, and share what ever blame or honor there may attach to the conduct of it. 1188 (Listed as 1138)</answer>
  <question>Or responsibility?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, or responsibility. We may differ in opinion however, as to what each other may write.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1189</questionnumber>
  <question>Will you state why you do not or have not received that as a revelation to the church?</question>
  <answer>Simply because I do not know anything about the conditions.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1190</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you say to that question?</question>
  <answer>I said that I did not know anything bout the history of the whole affair personally.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1191</questionnumber>
  <question>That is about the revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I don't know anything about it, and do not know that it is a revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1192</questionnumber>
  <question>is that not in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>No that I know of. I do not blieve it is. I know I never saw it there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1193</questionnumber>
  <question>What has the re-organized church received in the way of revelations other than what are in the Book of doctrine and covenants.</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that the same is irrelevant, incompetent and immeterial and is improper cross-examination.</mono>
  <answer>Some of the revelations the re-organized church has received are not incorporated in the book of doctrine and covenants. There is an order from the Conference authorizing it however so far as we are concerned.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1194</questionnumber>
  <question>And are any revelations given by yourself, received and acted upon as doctrines or rules of the church, that have not been passed upon by the church?</question>
  <answer>As I state on yesterday, - at times when exigency requires such as been done, and the matt-has been subsequently examined and approved or dissaproved, as the case may be, but it is acted upon until dissaproved, because that exigency, - or the exigency or urgency of the case required it, and there was no conference or meeting of the body to which the matter could be referred in time to have passed upon before the emergency arose.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1195</questionnumber>
  <question>In such a case it is accepted until dissaproved.</question>
  <answer>It is acted upon, but not after it is dissaproved. Such matters are merely matters of instruction or direction.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1196</questionnumber>
  <question>In Exhibit J, on page one hundred and two, section nineteen, paragraph two, occurs the following, - "Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt given heed to all his words and commandments, which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me; for his word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith; for by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his names glory. For thus saith the Lord God, him have I inspired to move the cause of Zion, in mighty power for good; and his diligence I know, and his prayers I have heard; yea, his weeping for Zion I have seen, and I will cause that he shall mourn for her no longer, for his days of rejoicing have come unto the remission of his sins, and the manifastations of my blessings upon his works". Now the topic of that revelation is "Revelation to Joseph Smith, Jr., given April 6th 1830"</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "It don'y seem to me that that is a proper way to examine a witness, to take a book and read from it yourself. It seems to me that the proper way would be to put the book in the hands of the witness, and stand by him, and see that it is read properly before requiring any answer. I simply say that as a suggestion for I think that is the proper way". By Mr Southern,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1197</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Very well, I think your suggestion is a good one, and I will avail myself of it for I do not think that I am inclined to take any advantage of the witness. Mr Smith will you take this book, Exhibit J, and read section nineteen, beginning at the topic, and reading paragraph one?

  <answer>"Revelation to Joseph Smith, Junior. Given April 26 1830. Behold, there shall be a record kept among you, and in it thou shalt be called a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the Church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ: being inspired of the Holy Ghost to lay the foundation thereof, and to build it up unto the most holy faith; which Church was organized and established in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and thirty, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month, which is called April. Wherefore, meaning the (church,) thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments, which he shall give unto you, as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me; for his word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth in all patience and faith; for by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his names glory. For thus saith the Lord God, him have I inspired to move the cause of Zion in might power for good; and his diligence I know, and his prayers I have heard, yea, his weeping for Zion I have seen, and I will cause that he shall mourn for her no longer, for his days of rejoicing are come unto the remission of his sins, and the manifestations of my blessings upon his works. For behold I will bless all those who labor in my vineyard, with a mighty blessing, and they shall believe in his words which are given him through me, by the Comforter, which manifesteth that Jesus was crucified by sinful men, for the sins of the world; yea, for the remission of sins unto the contrite heart. Wherefore it behooveth me that he should be ordained by you Oliver Cowdery, mine apostle; this being an ordinance unto you, that you are an elder under his hand, he being the first unto you, that you might be an elder unto this Church of Christ, bearing my name; and the first preacher of this church unto the church, and before the world; yea, before the Gentiles; yea, and thus saith the Lord God, lo, lo, to the Jews, also, Amen.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1199</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>1203</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is that answer?</question>
  <answer>I stand in the position to receive and give the church that which may be given to me, in the same manner as is stated in that section, whicj I have just read, as the successor of my father.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1204</questionnumber>
  <question>Do I understand you correctly when I say that in your testimony, as I understand it, you say, you say that you hold the same office in the re-organized church that your father held in the old church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1205</questionnumber>
  <question>You stand in the same position to receive and deliver revelation to the re-organized church that your father stood in to receive and deliver revelation to the old church?</question>

  <questionnumber>1206</questionnumber>
  <question>Then are you an apostle?</question>
  <answer>I am.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1207</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you ever ordained as an apostle?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1208</questionnumber>
  <question>Where were you ordained as an apostle?</question>
  <answer>Well I was ordained an high priest, which makes me an apostle, but I am not standing in the quorom of Twelve apostles.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1209</questionnumber>
  <question>Are all high priests apostles?</question>
  <answer>They are when they are engaged in apostolic work.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1210</questionnumber>
  <question>Do they engage in apostolic work unless they are ordained and set apart as apostles?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. They are appointed by the conferences, and so are the seventy, and an elder may be the same thing, but they do not belong to the apostles or leading quoroms as members of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1211</questionnumber>
  <question>Is any one considered an apostle of the church until he has been ordained to the office of an apostle?</question>
  <answer>They are when they do apostolic work, but they do not hold that specific office in the quorom. Joseph Smith is called an apostle although he was not with the twelve.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1212</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any other rule governing the rule of reception of revelation by the church, - the re-organized church, - than that found in the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>Nothing more than many have transpired from the customs of the church, and and what may have been recorded in current history.</answer>

  <question>In what respect do they differ from this rule given here in this revelation? In this revelation given in section nineteen of Exhibit J?</question>
  <answer>They do not differ from it materially, - only in elucidation of detail, - that is all.</answer>

  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1221</questionnumber>
  <question>And those rules, - those particular rules, which you last stated are not found in the Book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>Not all of them. Some of them are.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1222</questionnumber>
  <question>But are found in the customs of the church which have sprung up?</question>
  <answer>The basis of them are to be found in the organic law of the church, and as matter or condition have developed in the work of ofganization, necessities have arisen, upon which it was necessary to work out matters of detail.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1223</questionnumber>
  <question>And revelations as I now understand you, in the re-organized church, to be of force in the church, must be submitted to the various bodies of the church for which they are intended?</question>
  <answer>Before they can be recorded and become a law or rule binding upon the church, they must be so received and accepted upon.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1224</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that the law or rule in the old church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I believe so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1225</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you knw whether it was or was not?</question>
  <answer>I so understand it, but of course I could not answer you positively and definitely upon that question. I could not say positively of my own knowledge whether it was or not, but that is my understanding.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1226</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that the case as laid down in the doctrine we have just read.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1227</questionnumber>
  <question>They are precedents for this rule?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>But the precedents are not to be found in this doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but they are to be found in the traditional teachings of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1229</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know from your historical re-search whether there was ever such a rule in force prior to 1835?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1230</questionnumber>
  <question>Of course then you do not know from any other scource?</question>
  <answer>Only from history and common custom. I told you I was not cognizant of what took place when I was a small boy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1231</questionnumber>
  <question>now you have said that it was not necessary that an apostle should be ordained?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1232</questionnumber>
  <question>It is not necessary that an apostle should be ordained?</question>
  <answer>I did not so state Colonel.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1233</questionnumber>
  <question>Excuse me, - Ordained as an apostle I meant, - it was not necessary that an apostle should be ordained as such? Did you not so state the fact to be?</question>
  <answer>You asked me the question if I remember rightly, whether a man can be an apostle without being ordained, especially to the apostolic office or quorom and I answered yes, if he acted in the capacity of an apostle, and was in fact an apostle.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1234</questionnumber>
  <question>Could he be an apostle without being ordained?</question>
  <answer>No sir, he must be ordained to the Melchesidical priesthood, but when he is ordained as an apostle, he is of course an apostle.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1235</questionnumber>
  <question>Then could any one hold an office in the church, - the office of apostle who is an apostle?</question>
  <answer>I do not know that I understand the question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1236</questionnumber>
  <question>Could any one hold the office of an apostle in the church without being ordained?</question>
  <answer>No sir, he must first be ordained to the priesthood.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1237</questionnumber>
  <question>But not to the office of an apostle?</question>
  <answer>He may be an apostle I said without belonging to the quorom of twelve. Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were recognized as apostles and did not belong to the twelve.</answer>

  <question>Do you say they were not?</question>

  <question>Does the reorganized church accept that as a fact?</question>
  <answer>They accept it as it is stated there. Council for the plaintiff moves the court to exclude from the record the question and answer bearing on the matter asked in the last question on the ground that both the question asked the witness and the answer of the witness thereto are incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination.</answer>

  <answer>I believe I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1247</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is it?</question>
  <answer>We understand it to mean the introduction of doctrines and practices subversive of the faith of the church and that in such a case the church in its organized quorum capacity, the church that does that is rejected of God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1248</questionnumber>
  <question>Rejected by God?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, you can put it that way if you desire. And also those who remained pure and steadfast in the principles as they held them and believed them, and after which they were baptized. Now that is the way we understand it Colonel.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1249</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when did that rejection take place?</question>
  <answer>Well we draw the line for the acknowledgement or recognition of authority at the time of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1250</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when was that?</question>
  <answer>June 27th 1844. All baptism performed in the church prior to that time we consider valid and good, but baptisms performed subsequent to that we consider them to be subject to inquiry as to their character.</answer>

  <question>I will with draw that question. Where did the church get the authority for submitting to the quoroms and body for their endorsement, - for submitting revelations after they have been received to the quoroms and body for their endorsement?</question>
  <answer>We get it from the bible, - the teachings of the bible and book of Mormon, and the revelation to the church in an early day, which required that the common consent of the people should be obtained, - I many say shall be obtained, for I take it that it is mandatory, - we have an illustration in the giving of the law from Sinia, and its submission to the people by Moses, and its acceptance by them, and the consequences attending its acceptance or rejection according to the word of God.</answer>

  <question>I will withdraw the question and asked you to state what the fact is about that Mr Smith?</question>
  <answer>The re-organization has endeavored to follow the teachings and precepts of the old church from its inception. Now there is items often that requires or states that the three leading quoroms of the church have, what may be called a concurrent jurisdiction, and the decision by either one of them is equivalent to a decision by either of the others, requiring or exercising a neutralizing power in cases of conflict, so that the rights of the people may be kept free from imposition of false doctrine or theory by any body, and also in the rules of the doctrine and covenants be submitted to the body for their action, for approval or dissaproval at the conferences held from time to time when they meet.</answer>

  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "I enter a formal objection to this offer of proof, because it it not responsive to the cross examination, and should have been out in, if put it at all, on the examination in chief." Paragraph four, section forty three of exhibit E, the same being the doctrine and covenants, edition of 1835, offered in evidence, is an follows, to wit, - "And if your joy will be great with one soul, that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great shall be your joy if you shall bring many souls unto me? Behold you have my gospel before you, and my rock, and my salvation; ask the Father in my name in faith believing that you shall receive, and you shall have the Holy Ghost; which manifesteth all things, which is expedient unto the children of men. And if you have not faith, hope and charity, you can do nothing. Contend against no church, save it be the church of the devil. Take upon you the name of Christ, and speak the truth in soberness, and as many as repent, and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and endure ot the end the same shall be saved. Behold Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father, and there is none other given whereby man can be saved; wherefor all men must take upon them the name which is given by the Father, for in that name shall they be called in the last days; wherefore if they know not the name by which they are called they can not have place in the kingdom of my Father".

  <answer>I don't know that there is any specific rule.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1562</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact Mr Smith that there is no such a rule or law?</question>
  <answer>I say I don't know of any specific rule, except the drift of the teaching, that a paerson having been receiving into membership and having become identified with the church, that his right to be regarded as a member ceases by virtue of transgression up his own part from the faith, or expulsion for cause may follow. That is the drift of the teaching of the church and there cannot be question but that our church or any other has that right to discipline its members, and even proceed to the length of expulsion for cause.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1565</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you undertake to exclude any one who had gone off with those other organizations?</question>

  <answer>Why did we not do what?</answer>

  <question>Why did you not discipline them?</question>
  <answer>Simply because we did not deem it to be necessary.</answer>

  <question>Upon what knowledge of his former connection with the church did you receive him?</question>
  <answer>There were members of our reorganized church who were also members of the original church who certified as to his standing at the time he was received, and the records also show what his standing was.</answer>

  <question>His standing where, in the old or in the reorganized church?</question>
  <answer>In the old original church, the records show what his standing was there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1622</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you any law or revelation authorizing the reception of members in that way?</question>
  <answer>I do not know that we have any law specifically. We have no law any more than when a person presents himself who is known to have been a member of the old church, and when the fact can be substantiated by oral testimony of witnesses who of their own knowledge know it to be a fact, and that knowledge being brought to the attention of the body who has the matter of acceptance in hand, they receive it as a proof and admit them. It is merely a custom so to speak that has grown out of the exigency of the occasion.</answer>

  <question>According to the laws of your church, by what authority is a man ordained an apostle?</question>
  <answer>He is ordained to the office of an apostle upon it appearing to the satisfaction of the body that he is called to the office and when he is nominated and received by a vote of the body and then he is ordained.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1627</questionnumber>
  <question>How does the body call him?</question>
  <answer>It may be done in several ways so far as the body is concerned.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1628</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do far as the body is concerned how is it done?</question>
  <answer>He is presented to the body and statements are made concerning the call, and the office to which he may be called and the call is then examined and acted upon, and if the people are satisfied with the call and the fitness of the individual received it, the call is ratified, and the rite of ordination performed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1629</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it necessary that the call shall be a revelation?</question>
  <answer>We so understand it. It must be a revelation in some form.</answer>

  <question>Was William B. Smith so called?</question>
  <answer>I could not tell you.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that the same in incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and is improper recross examination, and calls for the legal opinion of the witness, when it appears that the witness is not a lawyer.</mono>
  <answer>If the body chooses to ordain a man to the office of an apostle so far as the body is concerned, they would be bound by his acts, but whether he is called by the Almighty or not, that is a question we do not propose to determine.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1633</questionnumber>
  <question>Well Mr Smith I believe that is a fact, and I have to beg your pardon for asking it a fourth time. I will try and ask you a question that you have not already answered. Was there a law in the church that required a member to be called by revelation?</question>
  <answer>I told you that the rule is so far as we are concerned, and you are asking me what the rule was in the former days in the original church and I have told you I do not know what the rule is or was in those days for that was before my time or my connection with the church.</answer>

  <answer>Did I assume to reject it,</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1638</questionnumber>
  <question>By what authority did the reorganized church assume to reject that call?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, is improper cross examination, and calls for an opinion of the witness</mono>
  <answer>It would depend on the circumstances surrounding the attaching the case, and the conditions concerning it at the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1639</questionnumber>
  <question>In other words you mean to say the re- that the re-organized church would do about it just as they pleased?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, so far as that is concerned they would</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1640</questionnumber>
  <question>And the reorganized church is a law unto itself in those matters?</question>
  <answer>No sir I do not assume to say anything of the kind, but I do presume to say that the reorganized church acts upon its understanding of the rules and the organic laws of the church under which it is organized and acting and by which it is governed in all its actions as we construe it</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1641</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what you presume to say on this question?</question>

  <answer>The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.</answer>

  <question>Well has it since been recognized as one of the official works of the church?</question>
  <answer>It is and has been recognized as one of the standard works of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1664</questionnumber>
  <question>By which the church is to be guided in its doctrines?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir in connection with the King James translation, and in connection with the book of Mormon and the book of doctrine and covenants. It becomes simply one of the standard books of the church according to what it purports to be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1665</questionnumber>
  <question>You identified in your re-examination inchief, some two or three books of the book of doctrine and covenants, that I believe has not been presented before, - one of which I believe was published in 1852.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1668</questionnumber>
  <question>What difference is there between this book exhibit I, and the other editions of the same book that have been presented here?</question>
  <answer>I believe there is some parts a little diferenence possibly, but in the main they are the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1669</questionnumber>
  <question>They are substantially the same?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1670</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there anything added to these books since the first edition was published in 1835?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1671</questionnumber>
  <question>What has been added?</question>
  <answer>One or two articles I presume, and on the martyrdom I think was added, and there may have been some others, the revelation of 1834 I expect, but I could not say specifically as to what has been added.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1672</questionnumber>
  <question>Are those books not also regarded as standard books of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That book was published by the Utah Church, or the branch that adheres to them in England, and in so far as it is correct it is accepted by the re-organized church as one of its standard books.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1673</questionnumber>
  <question>That church is known as the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - that is the official title of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1674</questionnumber>
  <question>And they published the European edition of this book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1675</questionnumber>
  <question>Has any body come from the Salt Lake Church to the reorganized church for membership?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1676</questionnumber>
  <question>How many?</question>
  <answer>I couldn't tell you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1677</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about how many?</question>
  <answer>I could not say, but quite a number. We emigrated eight hundred this way one year under the aid and with the assistance of some government official.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1678</questionnumber>
  <question>About what year was that?</question>
  <answer>Well I couldn't tell you the date of that either. The first missionary we sent out there was in 1863, and from that time on we have been doing evangelical work there, and have been preaching to them ever since.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1679</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you require of members of the Utah church who come to your church for reception?</question>
  <answer>If they have been baptized in my fathers day, we simply require them to identify their baptism, and receive them all on their baptism the same as we do any one else.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1680</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you required this from all the converts you have made in the Utah church, - that is have you required them to established their baptism in the original church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - if they were baptized in the old original church in my fathers day, they were received into the reorganized church on that baptism.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1681</questionnumber>
  <question>They are received into the different districts or branches in that manner?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1682</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you any rule governing the admission of these converts or accessions to your numbers in the districts or branches?</question>
  <answer>We have had the general expression of the conferences on that question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1683</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what has been the general expression of the conferences upon it?</question>
  <answer>It is substantially this, that all who have been, or were baptized prior to 1844, if sufficient evidence of the fact was presented they were considered eligible for admission into the reorganized church, but if they have been baptized since that time, we take into consideration the standing of the individual who baptized them, and his standing or authority to perform the rite of baptism. All these things were taken into consideration, and if there was any individual baptized, whose baptism the Spirit recognized, we could not deny him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1684</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that the case not - withstanding the fact that the man or person who baptized them, had not received his authority from the old church?</question>

    </pagenumber>presumed to question the legality of a baptism that we believe to have been made under the direct sanction of the Holy Ghost or the Spirit. It is not our province to question these things, therefore we do not do it.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1685</questionnumber>
  <question>have you or do you recognize baptisms as performed by the Utah church as of that kind?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1686</questionnumber>
  <question>At no time?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1687</questionnumber>
  <question>And do not know?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1688</questionnumber>
  <question>If the testimony has been borne as you have told me, and the baptism is proved to have been performed in that way for an application from that church, what would be the modus operandi pursued in that case?</question>
  <answer>I told you this, - that if there has been any applications in that way, they have been received on the principle but I know of none.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1689</questionnumber>
  <question>Although the party baptizing them was a member of the Utah church prior to the baptism?</question>
  <answer>I will state our position again, - persons whose baptism has been certified to orally by witnesses as having been made before the death of Joseph Smith are received on that baptism, but persons who have been baptized in these other factions or organizations which the reorganized church does not recognize, but who come to us for admission into our church are not received on that baptism. In the one case we do not question the baptism for it is not our province to do so, and in the other we do not accept it unless they are persons who were baptized in the original church before the dispersion, and although they have gone off with one of these factions, if they come to us with pentience and a desire to atone for their transgression we receive them on their original baptism.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1690</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that a fact although they were baptized by the Utah Church or by some one authorized to administer baptism in that church?</question>
  <answer>As you do not seem to understand me I will make my statement again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1691</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it is not necessary to state it again. I asked you if assuming that to be a fact, or what you state to be a fact, I want to know if the individual who performed it was an official in the Utah church, and the man had been received into the Utah church, you would renounce that baptism, and would not recognize it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and we would do-the very thing if it was a baptism of any of the other churches. It matters not what organization or so called faction of the church it might be, we would do the same, - the same course is pursued uniformally in all such cases.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1692</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, that is clear. How do you receive members into the reorganized church any how?</question>
  <answer>We receive them if they have been members of the old church up their original baptism, and they are received by a vote. Suppose for an example that John N. Southern had been a member of the original church, and he should desire to become united with the reorganized church, and should present himself before a branch, or before the conference as the case might be, and it should be known to any person present and he was a member of the original church, we would receive him upon that recognition by the uplifted hand, and order his name enrolled amongst the names of the church members.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1693</questionnumber>
  <question>Well suppose that in 1837 or 1840 if you had followed Brigham Young and had gone to Utah, -suppose that John N. Southern had done that, instead of your self, - and had been a member of the church there, although a member of the old church, would you have received him?</question>
  <answer>
    If he had come back to us penitent for his action, we most assuredly would receive him, and we would have killed the fatted calf in token of our joy at his return. Those are the very

    </pagenumber>kind of cases we rejoice in welcoming.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1694</questionnumber>
  <question>Would you make an inquiry of it about him, other than you would about other people?</question>
  <answer>No sir, he would be subjected to no more rigid test than others,.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1695</questionnumber>
  <question>You would not?</question>
  <answer>No sir - , I don't see how we consistently could.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1696</questionnumber>
  <question>Not-with-standing the fact that he had been a member of the Utah church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, - we make no distinctions, - we could not do - that. He would be received like all others on his original baptism.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1697</questionnumber>
  <question>Would you ask him regarding his repentance or require a confession of his error from him?</question>
  <answer>Certainly he would have to acknowledge his error, and show to the satisfaction of the body passing on his case that he was repentant for his course, else he could not be received, but upon that showing we would welcome him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1698</questionnumber>
  <question>You would expect to have him exhibit repentance for his course then?</question>
  <answer>Certainly, he would have to exhibit his penitence for his transgression.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1699</questionnumber>
  <question>And that he had left those ways?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that he had forsaken the path of his transgression.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1700</questionnumber>
  <question>Andd that could be shown by himself, - he could show it by his own statement?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and by his conduct, and the testimony of others in good standing in the church who knew the facts. Testimony corroborative of his statement could be borne at the same time by those who knew him, and knew of his deportment.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1701</questionnumber>
  <question>If that individual had held an office in the Utah Church, - an official position, and had been ordained to that official position would you recognize his official position upon his uniting with the reorganized church?</question>
  <answer>Would you do what, - I don't understand the question, for I did not hear it properly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1702</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if an individual should come to your church, - the reorganized church, seeking to be admitted to its membership, who had been a member, or was a member of the Utah church, and had been appointed or selected to an official position in that church to which he had been duly ordained by the proper officials in that church to conduct such an organization, would you recognize the official position he had held in the Utah church upon his becoming a member of your church in the form and manner indicated in your former answer?</question>
  <answer>No sir, unless it was a position to which he had been ordained prior to the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1703</questionnumber>
  <question>If there was an office or position to which he had been ordained after the death of Joseph Smith you would not recognize it?</question>
  <answer>No sir - (1704 - 1707 are missing)</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1708</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it is a fact Mr. Smith that if he fell away from those doctrines, which you say were taught and practiced in the old church, and had gone off with one of these factions and had acted with them for years, and if he had been a person holding a high position in the original church prior to the death of your father, you would not consider this fact of his falling away from the true church as robbing him of any one of the attributed with which he had been originally invested upon being ordained to his office in the days of your father?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1709</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you recognize that position with justice and equity Mr. Smith?</question>
  <answer>We base it upon the principle stated by Ezekiel, that "if the wicked man forsake the evil of his way, the evil thae he has done shall not be remembered against him", - that is the substance of the principle we act upon.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1710</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Then it is a law of your church in receiving the members from

    </pagenumber>these other factions, as you term them, that when they come back to the reorganized church for reception, that their apostasy, so called is not destroyed, - has not destroyed I should say, - not made void, the official functions which inhered in them at the time they received the gift of those functions in the church prior to the death of your father?
  </question>
  <answer>Now if you will permit me and give me time I will make this as clear as I can, so you can understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1711</questionnumber>
  <question>Well sir you have my consent to do so?</question>
  <answer>An individual who was an officer in the church in my fathers day, though he may have fallen into transgression, should he return to what we understand to be the proper church, the question upon his reception and the nature of his standing would be determined by what the man had done, - that is what the man had been bfore his transgression, and what his office had been in the church to which he had connected himself, and the question would arise if under the circumstances it was not deemed proper nor wise, his standing would not be recognized, and if it should be recognized by the body that he is entitled to recognition as an office, it must be done by a vote of the people in the reorganized church properly had and presented. That is the course that would have to be pursued.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1712</questionnumber>
  <question>And do you add to that answer "another ordination"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir and another re-affirmation of his authority?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1713</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it an office that requires ordination, if you require an reordination?</question>
  <answer>It requires a re-affirmation of the office he held.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1714</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that a rule of your church?</question>
  <answer>It is a rule or custom which ever you may choose to call it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1715</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if you required under these circumstances another ordination, and you answer that it requires a re-affirmation. Now what I ask is, does it require another ordination, if he had been ordained before?</question>
  <answer>We require that his authority shall be re-affirmed on him, or in him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1716</questionnumber>
  <question>Will you please answer the question?</question>
  <answer>I think I have.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1717</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I don't think so?</question>
  <answer>What is the question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1718</questionnumber>
  <question>Under these circumstances would you require a reordination?</question>
  <answer>We require that his authorite shall be re-affirmed in him or on him by a vote of he people.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1719</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how was that re-affirmation to be made?</question>
  <answer>By the laying on of hands and setting him apart to act in the office to which he has been reaffirmed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1720</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that a method of ordination?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1721</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the method that would be pursued in this case?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1722</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say you require a re-affirmation or ordination of men who come from other branches or factions of this church has has been detailed here, and now I want to raise this question, - were those men who were assembled in 1852, - were they ordained, - the men who assembled there together in 1852, and was the ordinance of reordination performed at that time on them or any other time?</question>
  <answer>I could not say as to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1723</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know whether they were re-affirmed or re-ordained, or anything as to that?</question>
  <answer>No sir I do not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1724</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that the majority of the church or of the people who assembled at Newark, Wisconsin in 1852, came out of the Strang faction, or "Strangites", as they were called?</question>
  <answer>I couldn't say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1725</questionnumber>
  <question>You can't say as to that, for you were not there?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I was not there, therefore I cannot say.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>1726</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know then whether or not it is a fact that most of the people gathered there at that meeting belonged to the Strang faction?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I could not say, I have heard that there was some, - in fact I know there was some there that belongs to that faction, but how many there was of them I could not say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1727</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe you have described how they come together of their own accord and organized themselves in to a conference in 1852?</question>
  <answer>Yesterday you had it impressed upon your mind in some way the original initial movement occured in 1852, but it was in 1851 that the movement began in different places, but they after some negotiation agreed upon a meeting or conference in 1852, and in pursuance of that agreement that met at Newark.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1728</questionnumber>
  <question>They came together there voluntarily, each individual acting for himself?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they met there, and effected the reorganization of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1729</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe that is all I have to ask you Mr Smith.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Redirect examination by Mr Kelley,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1730</questionnumber>
  <question>You were asked in your re-cross examination Mr Smith as to whether or not you did anything in the way of disciplining these recalcitrant members of the original church, and to what you answered you did nothing? Now I will ask you what the reorganized church did or does with reference to re-claiming these members? Or those parties I should say?</question>
  <answer>With reference to reclaiming them?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1731</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, - with reference to their re-claimation, - or trying to accomplish that end?</question>
  <answer>We sent missionaries to them and also issued pamphlets and circulated them so far as we would among them both in Utah, and amongst those persons who were travelling to Utah, on - the cars and elsewhere. We also stationed an ambassay at Kansas City, Omaha and Florence, and members of the church at Nebraska City attended to the work there, and tried to intercept all the converts we could while travelling on their way - to Utah. We guarded and watched all the crossing points on the Missouri River to try and restrain and reclaim parties, and we have a missionary in Utah ever sine 1863.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1732</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that same thing true with all these different factions, - what you have been stating about the efforts made on behalf of the Utah faction?</question>
  <answer>We have not made the same effort in regard to them that we have made in Utah, although we have held meetings in their neighbourhoods.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1733</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you sent elders and missionaries to them?</question>
  <answer>Not in any special way, but in travelling when they could do so they have went to them, when they could visit them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1734</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what has been the result of these missionary efforts?</question>
  <answer>Well in reference to Utah, we have gathered a good many members in from there and large numbers from the fragments of these other organizations. The census of the United Sates in 1880, if my memory serves me right reports eight hundred "Josephites" in the territory, besides those that came out. We have organizations at different places there, and missionaries still there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1735</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you if the "Josephites" in the territory of Utah, are all monogamists, and have been since their connection with the reorganization of this church?</question>
  <answer>The have been so far as it has come to our knowledge at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1736</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you Mr Smith if you have ever known of an instance, as you term it, of the Holy Spirit, certifying to a baptism, or to the fact of baptism, -to the validity of a baptism that was performed by any person not properly authorized in the original church or properly authorized in the reorganized church?</question>

  <answer>No sir. No such an instance has ever come under my own personal observation.</answer>
  <mono>Re-cross examination by Mr Southern,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1737</questionnumber>
  <question>I want to ask this question, - Now could the church reorganized in 1852 reclaim that which had never belonged to it?</question>
  <answer>If the position assumed by the reorganized church was correct, they stand in the position, or in relation to those who were members of the original church in 1844 and prior to that time, that the Catholic church does to its membership, - though the may be scattered, and belong to other churches, yet the mother church never renounced its claim upon her children, and we claimed they were in error and we made an effort to redeem them, - or reclaim them I should say. We hold that they were members of the olh church, and for that reason it was our privelege and duty to make this effort for their reclaimation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1738</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it is not right to say that you reclaimed persona and brought them back to your church, who had never been members of your church?</question>
  <answer>Well that is a technical question that I don't pretend to determine.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1739</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say you never heard anything other than that a Josephite was a monogamist, - you never heard of one being other than that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1740</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now is it not a fact Mr Smith that the people out there are all monogamists, and those among them who are polygamists are keeping it rather dark just at the present time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1741</questionnumber>
  <question>And have been keeping it rather dark for several years, - they are not going around on the street corners and from the house tops proclaiming the fact that they are polygamists?</question>
  <answer>I should think not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1742</questionnumber>
  <question>But on the contrary they are keeping it as dark and quiet as they can?</question>
  <answer>Well I should hope so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1743</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a act that men who have plural wives are not advertising that fact?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for they are afraid of the Marshals.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1744</questionnumber>
  <question>And they have been keeping this quiet for several years?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. As a matter of fact though they were not very covert about it prior to "82.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1745</questionnumber>
  <question>And is it not a fact that the large majority of the Utah church were not polygamists?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not tell you only so far as I gave credit to their statements in regard to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1746</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, how far did you give credit to their statements?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and is nor proper re-cross examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1747</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is it not a fact that none of these various branches of the Mormon church at the present time, claim to practice polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Not if we credit what they state about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1748</questionnumber>
  <question>Now if we credit what they state, - is that your answer?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for personally I do not know any thing about it.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked for the reasons and on the grounds that the same is incompetent, and immeterial, and improper re-cross examination, and moves the court to exclude. __________________________ Sworn to before me on this day, within the hours and at the place in that behalf first aforesaid, and subscribed in my presence this ______ day of ______________ 1892. __________________________ Notary Public</mono>

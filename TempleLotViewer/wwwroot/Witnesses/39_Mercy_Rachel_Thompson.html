  <answer>Well must I say that I really saw and heard ceremonies to that effect to prove that I know it was practiced, or must I state what I was told plainly and positively by friends, and those who knew positively what they were talking about, and knew all the circumstances, some of whom were living in the practice at the time?</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. E.L. Kelley, - "Just state what you know about it of your own knowledge, and that is all." By Mr. P.P. Kelley, - "I move to exclude the last answer of the witness as immaterial, and hearsay."</mono>
  <answer>Well, the prophet himself told me it was a true principle, and was taught in the bible, - in the old bible, - and I believed it of course, because I could read it for myself in the bible and see that it was practiced in those days, and the Lord approved of it and sanctioned it, and I believed it was right os course, and believed what the prophet taught me, and he taught me that.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff mives the court to exclude the answer of the witness from the record for the reasons above given. Mr M. E.L. Kelley, - "As Mr. Smith is sitting in the room and is constantly prompting the witness, I wish the record to show that fact, and I will state that while we have no disposition to shut Mr. Smith out from where this testimony is being taken, yet if he does not cease his prompting we must decline to proceed with the examination of this witness at this place, and continue it at a place where it would be more proper for us to insist upon our legal right to have the testimony on the witness taken wothout any prompting. We came down here to accomodate Mr. Hall and the witness, and we desire that we be accorded fair play. I will say further that if Mr. Smith is to take any part in this examination either as counsel or party to it, we have no objection, only we desire the record to show that fact."</mono>
  <answer>I should desire to ask the privilege of having my nephew correct any dates or anything or that kind that I make a mistake in. I am a very old lady now, and my memory is failing me, and I can't remember the dates as I once could.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff desires the record to show that the witness in making this answer was constantly prompted by the daughter of the witness and Joseph F. Smith; and the examiner states that to quite a number of questions asked the witness, in the answers made thereto, the witness is prompted to make her answer in a certain manner. The witness is a very old lady, and appears to be very feeble and rather deaf, and complains of a failing memory, which is the explanation the parties above named offer for their prompting the witness; but they are warned by the examiner that they must desist from saying anything at all to the witness during the progress of this examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>106</questionnumber>
  <question>Now let me understand you Mrs. Thompson, - after the death of your husband, you lived alone in your own house for about one year?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for a little over a year.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how much over a year did you live alone in your own house after your husband died?</question>
  <answer>Well, my husband died in August 1841, - well it was two years of course, for I was married to Hyrum Smith on the 11th of August. It was just about two years after my husband's death.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>108</questionnumber>
  <question>You lived in your own house alone then for two years after your husband's death?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>109</questionnumber>
  <question>From 1841 in the month of August when your husband died, until the 11th of August 1843 when you married Hyrum Smith?</question>

    </pagenumber>course he had no place to go to, he came to my house and lived with me until he got, a place. He had no place when he first, came there ,and so he came and stayed with me for about four months, but I can't tell you whether it was the year before I moved over to brother Hyrum Smith's house or not. I can't tell anything about it, but I think it was in the first year after my husband died that he was living there with me.

  <questionnumber>113</questionnumber>
  <question>You were acquainted with the laws of the church up to that time were you not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>114</questionnumber>
  <question>And up to the time of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Certainly I was to some extent.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>115</questionnumber>
  <question>And attended the conferences?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. My husband at that time was private secretary and clerk to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>116</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am not asking you about that, and I move to exclude that from the record as not responsive to the question asked. Now in your examination by Mr. Hall, you stated that you heard Joseph Smith publicly teach the doctrine of polygamy, and advocate its practice? Now where did you ever hear him preach or teach the doctrine publicly?</question>
  <answer>Now let me see, - did I ever say, - did I say "publicly"? If I said "publicly" I did not mean that it was out on the stand or in the pulpit, but I meant that it was not taught to me alone, but to me along with others. You know I was not at many of their public meetings, and I can't say what he preached at the meetings I was at, but I have heard him teach it and explain it to several at a time in private when I was present.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>117</questionnumber>
  <question>If you used the word "publicly" then you were wrong in that statement?</question>
  <answer>Well now suppose I had a number of friends in the house, - just in the family circle, and it was taught to use that way, - should I call that public or private. That was the way it was taught to us, and you can call it what you like.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>118</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now you will have to determine that question for you are the witness?</question>
  <answer>Well now that is all I meant by public, - that is the way it was taught when I hear it, and if that is public, then it was taught publicly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>119</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you never heard him preach or teach it from the pulpit at all?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Not before that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>120</questionnumber>
  <question>At any time did you?</question>
  <answer>I can't say that I did only in that way, - in the family circle.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>121</questionnumber>
  <question>Or to any considerable number of people?</question>
  <answer>No sir not at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>122</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever at any time?</question>
  <answer>What?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>123</questionnumber>
  <question>Hear him teach it from the pulpit publicly?</question>
  <answer>Well now you know it was only a short time after that he was killed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>124</questionnumber>
  <question>Will you answer my question, - did you ever hear Joseph Smith teach the practice of polygamy from the pulpit, at any time, or at any place?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I really did. Only I well remember of his preaching and mentioning some things on that subject but not in the way of preaching or teaching us to practice it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>125</questionnumber>
  <question>You never heard Joseph Smith teach the practice of polygamy as is taught in the purported revelation on polygamy, that is now to be found in the book of doctrine and covenants published under the authority of the Utah church?</question>
  <answer>Before I was married?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>126</questionnumber>
  <question>No madam, - I am not asking you about any time or place, either before or after you were married, or at any other time whatever.</question>
  <answer>No, I don't know that I ever did.</answer>

  <question>Was there any more than that?</question>
  <answer>I think there was</answer>

  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>133</questionnumber>
  <question>It was not as early as 1840 then?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I told you before that I did not hear anything about it before 1841 that I recollect anything of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>134</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then, do you recollect of its being taught as early as 1841?</question>
  <answer>No, I would not say that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>135</questionnumber>
  <question>You would not say that you heard it taught as early as 1841?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I would not say that I heard it earlier than 1842, for I think it was about that time that I heard of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>136</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you hear it taught in 1842? Will you say that you heard it taught in 1842?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I heard it taught then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>137</questionnumber>
  <question>You heard it taught in 1842?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>138</questionnumber>
  <question>Whom did you hear it taught by?</question>
  <answer>By the prophet, but it was not made a public subject of discussion until late in 1842, - near the end of the year. Now gentlemen I am telling you according to the best of my knowledge, and I would not be willing to say any thing here that I would not be willing to swear to before the Lord, and I am not here tos say anything else.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>139</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you willing to swear now before the Lord that Joseph Smith taught you in 1842?</question>
  <answer>In 1842.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>140</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes?</question>
  <answer>It would be the latter part of 1842, - it would be the latter end of 1842, or the early part of 1843, - I wouldn't dare to say just which it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>141</questionnumber>
  <question>Well are you willing to swear before the Lord, that he taught it to you either in 1842 or 1843, - at any time during those years?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>142</questionnumber>
  <question>You are willing to so swear before the Lord?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I am willing to swear to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>143</questionnumber>
  <question>Now where was it?</question>
  <answer>Right in my own house.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>144</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was present?</question>
  <answer>And in his own house too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>145</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was present when he talked to you about it to you in your own house?</question>
  <answer>Well he came to be and talked to me about it, and at that time I don't recollect that there was anybody in particular present. I rather think that at that time we were alone.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>146</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it was a private conversation between you and he?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for you know he was in the habit of coming in and out of the houses there as he pleased and that is the way he came to my house and talked to me about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>147</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I don't know that, - you say I know it, and I don't know it.</question>
  <answer>Well I want you to understand sir, that there was nothing strange in his being there, and in his speaking to me about it as he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>148</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you say that you had private conversations with him at his own house about this matter of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Only when my sister was present.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>149</questionnumber>

    That is the only way he ever taught it to you, by

    </pagenumber>private conversations between yourselves, was it, - that is between you and himself, and between him and you and your sister? Now is that not the fact about it?
  </question>
  <answer>Well I would have to think a little before I could answer that question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>150</questionnumber>
  <question>Well take all the time you want to, to answer the question?</question>
  <answer>Of course I am acquainted with circumstances, but then I would not want to swear to any thing I really did not see.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>151</questionnumber>
  <question>Well the question was if that was not, - if that was not the only manner in which Joseph Smith taught you the practice of polygamy, if it was no in private conversations between him and yourself on the one hand, and between him and yourself and your sister?</question>
  <answer>Well I think I have heard him preach it and teach it to a larger and more public congregation than that, though of course I cannot say positively, but I think I have.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>152</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you willing to swear now before the Lord that you ever heard him teach it in a more punlic, - that is a congregation more public than the congregation composed of himself, yourself and your sister?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>153</questionnumber>
  <question>You would not be willing to sear to that before the Lord?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I would not be willing to swear to it, but I believe I did. A person may believe many a thing that they cannot swear to you know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>154</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you would not swear to that?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I don't want to, but there is a great many things I know that I don't want to swear to.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>155</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say you believe it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I believe it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>156</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what makes you believe it, if you don't want to swear to it?</question>
  <answer>Well it because I think it is possible that I might have heard some things and forgotten them, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>157</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you don't think it is probable do you?</question>
  <answer>Well I know that he practiced it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>158</questionnumber>
  <question>You say he practiced it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>159</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you state that of your own knowledge?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>160</questionnumber>
  <question>Now to go back to the question I have asked you, and which you failed to answer, - you do not think it is probable that you ever heard him preach it or teach it rather, to a more extensixe audience than yourself and your sister?</question>
  <answer>I think I did, but I say I would not be positive about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>161</questionnumber>
  <question>You said you were married to Hyrum Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>162</questionnumber>
  <answer>Now hot were you married to Hyrum Smith?</answer>
  <answer>I was married to him by the prophet.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>163</questionnumber>
  <question>By "the prophet" you mean Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>164</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there a marriage ceremony used on that occasion?</question>
  <answer>Certainly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>165</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what ceremony was used?</question>
  <answer>The same that was used on the other occasion.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>166</questionnumber>
  <question>The same ceremony was used when you married Mr. Smith that was used when you married Mr. Thompson, is that what you wish to be understood as saying?</question>
  <answer>What is the question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>167</questionnumber>
  <question>The prophet used the same ceremony at the time that you married Hyrum Smith, that he used at the time that you married Mr. Thompson?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>168</questionnumber>
  <question>The same identical ceremony?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. So far as I know it was the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>169</questionnumber>
  <question>And no more?</question>
  <answer>Well now I don't know that I will be able to explain it. I can't say that I will be able to explain just how that was.</answer>

  <questionnumber>170</questionnumber>
  <question>You dont know that you will be able to explain it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for in this case it was a proxy case.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>171</questionnumber>
  <question>What did you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>Well I mean that it was a case where there was proxy in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>172</questionnumber>
  <question>In the marriage ceremony?</question>
  <answer>Ye sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>173</questionnumber>
  <question>I thought you said it was the same as the ceremony that was used on the occasion of your marriage to Mr. Thompson?</question>
  <answer>Well it was with a little difference.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>174</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you mean to say that you were married to Hyrum Smith by proxy?</question>
  <answer>He made an agreement that he would deliver me up on the morning of the day of the resurrection to my husband Robert Blashel Thompson, but he would take charge of me for life, with the agreement to deliver me up to my husband on the morning of the resurrection.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>175</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what you mean by a marriage by proxy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>176</questionnumber>
  <question>Now were you not simply sealed to Hyrum Smith?</question>
  <answer>I was married to him for time, to be delivered up by him to my own husband on the morning of the day of the resurrection.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>177</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what you call or has been taught in the church here in Utah as sealings, is it not, -sealings for time only, and not for time and eternity?</question>
  <answer>We call it sealing when we are married in that way because we are only married for time and not for eternity, -we are sealed in the first instance for time and for all eternity, and that was the way it would be with my first husband, but with Hyrum Smith when I was married to him I was only married for time and in eternity on the day of the resurrection he agreed to deliver me up to my husband.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>178</questionnumber>
  <question>And the agreement on the part of Hyrum Smith when you were married as you call it was, that he would take charge of you for time, and in eternity he would deliver you up to your husband Thompson?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>179</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he to deliver the children up too?</question>
  <answer>If we had had any he would, but we didn't have any, for you know he was murdered soon after that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>180</questionnumber>
  <question>This was in 1843 when you were married to him, was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>181</questionnumber>
  <question>In August 1843?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>182</questionnumber>
  <question>On the 11th day of August I believe you stated?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and in June 1844 he was maasacred.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>183</questionnumber>
  <question>It was almost a year that you was married to him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>184</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there any children from that sealing or marriage?</question>
  <answer>No sir I told you there wasn't any.</answer>

  <question>Is this the only child you ever had, that is living here with you now?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>186</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the ceremony on the part of Hyrum Smith was that he would take charge of you during your life here on earth, and deliver you up together with what ever children might be raised as the fruits of the union between you and he, to your husband Thompson in eternity?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is it exactly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>187</questionnumber>
  <question>By what law of the church was that marriage made?</question>
  <answer>What is that? I don't hear very well?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>188</questionnumber>
  <question>By what law of the church was that marriage made and entered into?</question>
  <answer>By a law that was given to the prophet from the Lord. You now of course that he was a prophet of the Lord, and a law giver, and whatever the Lord gave to him or to the church through its prophet, was the law of the church.</answer>

    </pagenumber>about it, I don't pretend to know anything about it, only incidentally for the purposes of this case, and that is all.
  </question>
  <answer>Well I am speaking to you of the fact that he was the law giver, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>190</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was the law giver?</question>
  <answer>Joseph the prophet was. He was the law giver, and whatever he said was a law unto us.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>191</questionnumber>
  <question>He was a law unto you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>192</questionnumber>
  <question>In what respect?</question>
  <answer>Whatever he told us came from the Lord we accepted, and when he said that the word of the Lord was thus and so we knew it was so and believed it, without witnessing it ourselves, for we knew that he would not tell us that anything came from the Lord that did not come from the Lord.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>193</questionnumber>
  <question>You were bound to believe it?</question>
  <answer>Of course we believed it, and we believed it honestly too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>194</questionnumber>
  <question>You were bound to believe it?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that we were bound to believe it, but we did, - that is a certainty.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>195</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it a law of the church at the time that you married Hyrum Smith, that a man might have more wives than one?</question>
  <answer>Or course it was or I wouldn't have married him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>196</questionnumber>
  <question>Where is that law?</question>
  <answer>The law was in the prophet, - the voice of the Lord speaking through the mouth of the prophet Joseph Smith, and he declared that that was the law.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>197</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the law then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I don't know that we needed any other law.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>198</questionnumber>
  <question>Had it ever been adopted by the church as a law?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that the witness has stated that there was no action taken on it, and on the further ground that the question is immaterial and irrelevant, and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>There are some things that I know that I hardly think it is necessary to explain, for I don't think you would hardly understand about them if I did explain them to you.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Smith, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>199</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the questions the best you can. He is only asking you upon certain points, and he expects that you will answer them if you can. He expects you to answer the questions he asks you if you can, and you need not tell anything only what you know, and in reply to the questions he askes you. Now she does not understand he duty here on the witness stand and that is the reason I make this explanation to her.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Kelley, -</mono>

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>201</questionnumber>
  <question>It was the law of the church at that time?</question>
  <answer>yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>202</questionnumber>
  <question>When was that law accepted by the church if you know?</question>
  <answer>I don't know sir. I would not venture to tell that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>203</questionnumber>
  <question>Had it been accepted by the church at all?</question>

I am old and I can't remember these things very well, they happened so many years ago, and I can't hear very well either, and sometimes I am afraid I don't understand the questions; but I want to get these tings right and state them just as they were as nearly as I can, and I don't want to be doubtful or mistaken about anything.

  <answer>No sir, I day (say?) I don't remember. I may have seen it, but I don't remember.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>437</questionnumber>
  <question>The first definite recollection you have of seeing that revelation in print at any time, was the time that you first saw it in printed form as it appeared it (in?) the 1876 edition of the book of Doctrine and Covenants issued by the church here in Utah Territory?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I guess so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>438</questionnumber>
  <question>Although you have, or may have seen a publication of it by Orson Pratt?</question>

  <question>Now is the revelation on polygamy in that 1876 edition of the book of Doctrine and Covenants? I will withdraw that question. I will ask you how you are able to identify the revelation on polygamy as published in this book -that is in the 1876 edition of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, with the paper you saw there at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Why simply because they are alike.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>442</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how do you know they are alike?</question>
  <answer>I know they are alike for I saw it and read it, and I know they are the same. I saw them. I had it in my had, both of them, and I know they are the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>443</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't remember from 1843 to the preset time do you, and remember as an independent act of your memory that they are alike?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, of course I can, for that is an easy enough thing for me to remember.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>444</questionnumber>
  <question>And the only way you know is because you read what was on the paper you read in Nauvoo in 1843?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>445</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do not you recollect it from this fact, that it has been taught here as the same, and you have been told by other parties that it was the same?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>446</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say that is not a fact?</question>
  <answer>Of course I have heard that it is the same, but that don't make any difference with me, for I know and am perfectly satisfied that it is the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>447</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know from your own personal knowledge, and are you willing to swear from your own personal knowledge before God, that they are the same?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, according to the best of my knowledge and recollection.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>448</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you state anything that was in the one you read in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Well I read it here when it was published and I saw that it was the same. I would not be telling it as I am if it wasn't. I am telling the truth, and I say that I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that they are the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>449</questionnumber>
  <question>Well can you recollect any single paragraph or line that was in that paper that you say that you saw at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I can.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>450</questionnumber>
  <question>You cannot recollect back to 1843 and remember what you read then, so you could not state what it was?</question>
  <answer>
    No sir, I don't believe any body else could either. I cannot tell it straightforward, -that is tell just what was in it, but I know the principle that was taught in that revelation, and that is satis-

  <questionnumber>453</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it taught in any way either publicly or privately in 1841?</question>

  <mono>By Mr. Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>511</questionnumber>
  <question>Does it make that provision that there must be a temple?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and the prophet when he was there acted upon the word of the Lord and proceeded to erect a temple. If I am permitted I will go ahead and tell the whole thing. I will tell just how it was if I am permitted to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>512</questionnumber>
  <question>That is right, - go ahead and tell the whole thing?</question>
  <answer>That is, if there was communication between the eternal world and this, and I should never have been sealed to anybody, - if I had not obeyed the command of the Lord, when the Lord sent it through an angel to his prophet Joseph Smith, - and sent my own husband or a message from him in the eternal world to me through the prophet, and to his brother Hyrum that he should take me, and my little child, that is the word that my dead husband sent from the eternal world to brother Hyrum that he should take charge of me and my little child and keep us in this world an don the day of resurrection to deliver us up safely to my husband. Now that was the message from my husband to the prophet, or to brother Hyrum through the prophet, commanding Hyrum to take me to live with my sister with my little child, and he did not act on it quick enough, and so he came the second time, - or he went and enquired of the Lord, - and the Lord spoke to him through the angel, and when he inquired of the Lord the voice told him to go and do as his servant required him to do, and that was the time that he went to Hyrum and told him what he had been ordered to do, and then he sent my sister over to me to break the word to me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>513</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is that all?</question>

  <question>Well the fact is you don't know anything about that except what somebody else told you?</question>
  <answer>Only what the prophet told me, and I know it was straight from the Lord.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>520</questionnumber>
  <question>Did the prophet say that he got it from your husband that was dead?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>521</questionnumber>
  <question>He did not tell you that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>522</questionnumber>
  <question>How did he state to you he got it?</question>
  <answer>He said that the angel was sent straight from the Lord with the the angel was sent straight from the Lord with the message from my husband in the eternal wolrd making this request. Now I hope you understand me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>523</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I think I do. No what was when?</question>
  <answer>When did I get that message?</answer>

  <questionnumber>526</questionnumber>
  <question>How long was that before you was married to Hyrum Smith?</question>
  <answer>Well it was very soon afterwards that we were married, for I found out that as the Lord and my husband both required it of me, - required it of us, we did not dare refuse.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>527</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not feel at liberty to refuse the request?</question>

  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>531</questionnumber>
  <question>What made you marry him then if there was no command from the Lord to that effect, or a request from your husband in the eternal world?</question>
  <answer>Well I knew he was a man of God, and would not do anything only what was right, and I had satisfactory testimony myself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>532</questionnumber>
  <question>Now will you tell me how you happened to be sealed to John Taylor outside of the temple?</question>
  <answer>Because we had no temple.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>533</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that the law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>534</questionnumber>
  <question>Where can it be found?</question>
  <answer>I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>535</questionnumber>
  <question>You have always had a book of Doctrine of Covenants containing the law of he church, and yet you cannot tell where the law is on that point?</question>
  <answer>It is in there somewhere but I can't just turn to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>536</questionnumber>
  <question>Now don't the law of the church require the prophet to do the sealing?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, when we had a prophet it had to be done by him, but at that time the prophet was not here, - the prophet had gone to another world and the sealing had to be done by some one authorized to do the sealing before he left.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>537</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>541</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I want to know where the revelation from Joseph Smith is, that gave to Brigham Young the right to seal?</question>
  <answer>Well I was going to tell you all about it, for I think I can as I was present at the time and heard the prophet give that authority. I heard the prophet give that authority and power to Brigham Young, in case anything happened to him and that he should be absent or taken from the church, supposing at the time, or as I do now that he knew at that time, that is that the prophet knew at the time that he gave that authority to Brigham Young that he was to be soon taken from the church, that he was going to leave us and he wanted us to understand it so, for he said "now breather I want you to be very particular about the performance of all the ceremonies and ordinances of the church, and everything pertaining to these matters, so that if I should be called away, you could act without me" . Now that is what I heard him say, and that I can swear to.</answer>

  <questionnumber>544</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now that is what he said, as you have stated it?</question>
  <answer>Well of course I won't say that was exactly what was said, but that was about what he said, for I was there and heard him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>545</questionnumber>
  <question>You were a witness to that?</question>

  <questionnumber>639</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he only act as proxy with these other women?</question>

  <questionnumber>643</questionnumber>
  <question>Well didn't they live in Nauvoo while you were there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but it was such a short time afetr brother Hyrum married them that he was killed, that it is not likely that they had any children in that time.</answer>

  <questionnumber>647</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>656</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you can refresh your recollection by asking your daughter?</question>
  <mono>By Mr. Cabell, - "Well Counsel for the defendants objects to that. If you recollect say so, and if you do not recollect say so"?</mono>
  <answer>I know he had quite a number of wives, but as to knowing so that I can state all their names I can't do it, - that is all there is to it. If I had to suffer for it I can't tell their names, and I ought to remember them too.</answer>

  <question>Had the agreement to marry Lawson been made before you were divorced?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>794</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there a courtship between yourself and Lawson?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>795</questionnumber>
  <question>You never had any courtship with Lawson before you were married?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>796</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the marriage with Lawson was not on account of a love affair between yourself and Lawson?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know that it is necessary for me to state all the arrangements that were between me and him on account of my family. It was just like this, that there was such a state of affairs that made it almost a case of necessity that I should have some one to assist me and aid me in business matters, and so on.</answer>

  <questionnumber>797</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it was necessity that drove you to marry Lawson?</question>
  <answer>You might call it that, for I needed some one to assist me until my daughter grew up, to aid me in my business affairs.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>798</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you married on account of business principles.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was a good deal like that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>799</questionnumber>
  <question>Why did you refuse to answer the other day about your marriage with Lawson?</question>
  <answer>Well because I thought it hadn't anything to do with this case at all, and that was the reason, and I don't see yet that it has anything to do with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>800</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not say the other day that you were afraid to answer the question because it might tend to criminate you?</question>
  <answer>NO sir, I did not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>801</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you not say that it might tend to criminate you?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not say that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>802</questionnumber>
  <question>You swear positively that you did not say that?</question>
  <answer>I do say I did not say that. I said that because I thought it was folly to tell about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>803</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you don't think today that it is folly to repeat it?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>804</questionnumber>
  <question>In answer to questions asked you by Mr. Hall you answered willing enough, and did not think it was folly to tell all about it as you did the other day when I asked you the question?</question>
  <answer>Well I declined to answer your questions the other day because I thought there was no necessity for it, for I never dreamed that there was any necessity to go into it and tell all about that at all, - I never dreamed of such a think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>805</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what made you think it was necessary for us to come back down here today again to take your testimony, in which you have detailed this very thing, willingly enough too, which you declined to detail the other day were were here?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know, for I did not know you were coming, but when I saw that you were here I supposed you had come for some purpose, and I wanted to give satisfaction if I could for that is my general way of doing business.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>806</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you are in a much better mood today to give testimony then than you were the other time we were here?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I am sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>807</questionnumber>
  <question>well how did you come to send for us to come back here again today?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>808</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you send word that you wanted us to come back here today and take your evidence, because you wanted to make an explanation?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>809</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not send that kind of a word up?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>810</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>811</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not request any one to say to Mr. Hall to come back, that you wanted to make an explanation of your testimony?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is irrelevant and immaterial, and improper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I wish I could call to mind how that is, but I really cannot say how it is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>812</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you speak to anybody on that subject?</question>
  <answer>I don't know what I said to anybody on that subject. Let me see. (witness reflects.) I can't remember what it was. I am getting so old and feeble and my memory is so defective that I cannot remember some things of recent date half as well as I can some things that happened sixty years ago.</answer>

  <question>Now you said you received endowments in Nauvoo before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>814</questionnumber>
  <question>At what place?</question>
  <answer>At Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>815</questionnumber>
  <question>I mean at what place in Nauvoo? In what building?</question>
  <answer>In the Masonic Hall I rather think it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>816</questionnumber>
  <question>In the Masonic Hall?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think so. I think that was where it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>817</questionnumber>
  <question>Was all the ceremony performed in the Masonic Hall?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>818</questionnumber>
  <question>That washing was one in the Masonic Hall was it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>819</questionnumber>
  <question>And the anointing with oil was too?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>820</questionnumber>
  <question>Now what furniture was in the hall at the time?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants object to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not cross examination, and if by answering the question the witness would divulge anything that she has at any time taken an oath not to reveal, she is informed that she is under not obligation to answer the question.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>821</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question, - what furniture was in the hall at the time the endowment ceremony was performed?</question>
  <answer>Well now if you are expecting me to tell you all about the particulars of what was there in the way of furniture, and what was done there, - you must not expect me to do it any more than you would expect a Mason or an Odd Fellow or any other member of a secret society to reveal the secrets of their order.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>822</questionnumber>
  <question>Well Mr. Hall does not object to your answering the question , for we are not asking you anything about what transpired in the hall during the ceremony of conferring the endowments, but simply ask you about what was in the hall in the way of furniture? Mr. Hall asked you about the endowments, and now we have the right to find out what was done if we can?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't remember of him asking me anything about that at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>823</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am not asking you about the ceremony?</question>
  <answer>Well go on.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>824</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I asked you what was in the hall at the time the endowments were conferred in the way of furniture?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons as set forth in the last objection.</mono>
  <answer>Well I think to answer that question would be quite improper.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>825</questionnumber>
  <question>Was the furniture the same as is in any ordinary masonic lodge, room or hall?</question>
  <answer>Well it was the same as we have in the temple.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>826</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I don't know hat you have in the temple Mrs. Thompson?</question>
  <answer>Well I thought you wanted to know if it was the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>827</questionnumber>
  <question>No, I wanted to know if it was the same as it is in any Masonic Lodge?</question>
  <answer>I can't say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>828</questionnumber>
  <question>You can't say how that was?</question>
  <answer>I never was in a Masonic Lodge to my knowledge, and so I can't say how they are furnished.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>829</questionnumber>
  <question>You were in this one in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>I never was in a Masonic Lodge when there was any business carried on at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>830</questionnumber>
  <question>You were there when they were receiving the endowments?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>831</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did not the Masonic lodge occupy it at the same time?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>832</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I don't mean at the exact precise time that the endowments were being conferred, but there was a Masonic lodge that met there at regular specified meeting times, was there not?</question>
  <answer>
    Well I don't know. I would not say positively, but I think there was, although I might be mistaken in that. I would not say that it was in the Masonic Lodge room either for some times we met in a large brick room

    </pagenumber>there over the store, and I would be almost afraid to say for certain that we always met in that hall, but I think we did almost all the time. I know that I recollect something about the Masonic Lodge being used.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>833</questionnumber>
  <question>The Masonic Lodge was held over the store was it not?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I don't think it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>834</questionnumber>
  <question>Well the room that the lodge met in was over the store wasn't it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I think not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>835</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't think it was?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>836</questionnumber>
  <question>Now in taking your endowments did you change your clothing?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know what I am bound to answer that question. I don't know that that has any thing to do with this matter at all. I don't think that that is a matter that you really want to know anything about.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>837</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you not take an oath here to tell the truth and the whole truth?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think I did, but when I took that oath I was mistaken about it for I know I know I ought not to tell anything I am under an obligation not to tell anything about. I did not mean when I took the oath that I was to tell some thing I had no right to tell, and which it was not my place to tell.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>838</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you took an oath to tell the truth the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>839</questionnumber>
  <question>And now you don't want to disclose a part of the truth to me do you??</question>
  <answer>Well that is something I ought not to tell.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Cabell, - "Now with reference to this oath that you have taken to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, I want to inform you that it doe snot obligate you, or bind you to tell any secret in your endowments or any thing connected there with, that you took an oath not to reveal, and you are not obliged to that."</mono>
  <answer>I could not conscientiously do that, any more than I could conscientiously break my oath.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the instruction as to her duty or privilege, for the reason that the witness has not been interrogated regarding any part of the ceremony of endowments, and has not been interrogated regarding anything which she took an oath not to reveal. By Mr. Cabell, - "I would like the record to show that counsel for the defendants requests the Examiner to instruct the witness as to her privilege in this connection." By the Examiner, - "I think that your instruction to the witness covers the ground. Of course I am not here for the purpose of passing on these questions, or for the purpose of giving witness any instruction one way or the other, but simply to record the evidence that is given as to comes before me, and I cannot pass on any question that is objected to by either party when the witness refuses to answer, only by committing or refusing to committ the witness for such refusal. Now that is my idea for my duty in the prelises." By Mr. Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>840</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you did not take any obligation did you Mrs. Thompson, not to say at any time whether you changed your clothing or not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but at the same time I do not feel that I would be able to answer that question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>841</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you change your clothing in the taking of the endowments?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>842</questionnumber>
  <question>You did?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>843</questionnumber>
  <question>And you did yourself?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

    </pagenumber>always two rooms.
  </question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>845</questionnumber>
  <question>There was always two rooms?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - no I was mistaken about that, - there was always three rooms I think. Yes it was three rooms.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>846</questionnumber>
  <question>Two of them were ante-rooms, and the other one was the main room where the ceremonies were conducted?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>847</questionnumber>
  <question>There was a place in one of the ante-rooms where you were washed and anointed with oil?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>848</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they anoint the whole body with oil or just the head?</question>
  <answer>Well now there it is, - you are asking these question and I have answered then as far as I can, but these are questions, - or that is a question that I do not feel that I am called on to answer.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>849</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you take an oath not to tell at any time?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>850</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not take that kind of an oath?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>851</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then will you answer the question I ask you when they are question that relate to matters that you have not taken an oath not to divulge?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>852</questionnumber>
  <question>You will not answer the question?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>853</questionnumber>
  <question>Why not, - why do you refuse to answer the question?</question>
  <answer>I will not answer them for I do not feel disposed myself, not to answer them, for I don't think it is necessary.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>854</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't think it is necessary that you should answer them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>855</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is your reason for your refusal to answer them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>856</questionnumber>
  <question>You have been through two or three endowments since that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Still that is nothing whatever to do with this case that I can see.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>857</questionnumber>
  <question>Well have you been through two or three endowments since that time?</question>
  <answer>Well I suppose you understand that act for our dead sometimes, and I have been through endowments for my deceased friends.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>858</questionnumber>
  <question>Your endowments in Nauvoo were not for your deceased friends?</question>
  <answer>Well no, - yes we did then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>859</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, were your endowments in Nauvoo for your deceased friends?</question>
  <answer>I guess not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>860</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were they?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that was not till we got out here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>861</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you don't pretend that the endowments that you took in Nauvoo, were the endowments that are spoken of in the revelation of 1841?</question>
  <answer>I see no difference in them at any time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>862</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were they the endowments that are referred to in the boo of Doctrine and Covenants in the revelation of 1841?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>863</questionnumber>
  <question>Now don't the book of Doctrine and Covenants say that they must be performed in the temple?</question>
  <answer>Where there is a temple they are to be performed there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>864</questionnumber>
  <question>Does the book say that they are to be performed in the temple?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>865</questionnumber>
  <question>What does the book say, - does it say "when there is a temple"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>866</questionnumber>
  <question>You are satisfied that the book says when there is a temple the endowments are to be performed in it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>867</questionnumber>
  <question>You are satisfied that that is what the Lord said?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I am satisfied that that is what the Lord said to Joseph, because he told us to.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>868</questionnumber>
  <question>Who told you so, - the Lord or Joseph?</question>
  <answer>Joseph told us so, and I am satisfied that the Lord told him so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>869</questionnumber>
  <question>You remember everything just as Joseph told you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I believe I do.</answer>

  <questionnumber>870</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he tell you that all the endowments could be offered in the temple when you had one, and out of the temple when you did not have one?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>871</questionnumber>
  <question>He told you that, is that what you say?</question>
  <answer>He told us that the Lord accepted them just the same when we had no temple, and were doing our best to build it then he told us the Lord would accept it when it was offered in a suitable place.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>872</questionnumber>
  <question>You say that Joseph told you that the Lord accepted your endowments when they were offered outside the temple, in just the same manner as he would accept them if they were offered in the temple?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>873</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you are sure that is what he said?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>874</questionnumber>
  <question>But the revelation on that subject declares don't it, that they would not be accepted outside of the temple, that they would not be accepted unless they were offered in the temple.</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>875</questionnumber>
  <question>And it does not state that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it does not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>876</questionnumber>
  <question>You are certain of that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I am certain that the word of the Lord was that they would be accepted when they were offered outside of the temple if we were doing all we could to provide a temple, they would not be rejected because of the fact that we did not have a temple.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>877</questionnumber>
  <question>You are certain that was the word of the Lord?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I am certain of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>878</questionnumber>
  <question>Now were the endowments that you took in Nauvoo the same endowments that you took here? I refer to the endowments that you took for the dead in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they were exactly the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>879</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you say they were not exactly the same?</question>
  <answer>I said they were exactly the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>880</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you took endowments for the dead in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>I told you that I was not sure that I did, and so I don't say positively.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>881</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not just say that the endowments that you took for the dead were exactly the same as the endowments that you took here?</question>
  <answer>I said that I did not know whether they were or not. I said that I was not sure that I took the endowments there, but I think I didm and the endowments I took there were exactly the same as what I took here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>882</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were the endowments for the dead the same as the endowments for the living?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>883</questionnumber>
  <question>Just exactly the same.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>884</questionnumber>
  <question>In performing or conferring the endowments for the dead did they anoint all over the body?</question>
  <answer>Now there you are getting at the same question that you asked before and I objected to answering it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>885</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you decline to answer that question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>886</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you taken and obligation not to reveal that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>887</questionnumber>
  <question>Then why not tell me about that?</question>
  <answer>Because I don't feel disposed to tell you, that is something that you have no business to ask me, and so I don't feel like answering you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>888</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not feel disposed to answer that question?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I don't feel disposed to answer it, for as I said, I don't see that it is necessary that I should, and therefore I decline to answer it. If it is necessary for any purpose I can't see what it is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>889</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Well Mrs. Thompson we conceive that it is necessary for you to answer it. You have sworn here that the endowments were the same, and we conceive that it is necessary for you to answer them

    </pagenumber>to show the court what the endowments were, and let the court decide whether or not they are the same?
  </question>
  <answer>Well I say that it is not necessary anyway.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>890</questionnumber>
  <question>Well we insist that it is necessary, and we insist upon an answer? We think it is necessary for you to tell just what the endowments were in Nauvoo, and then tell just what they were her in Salt Lake, and then the Court will be able to say whether or not there was any difference?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Hall, - "Anything you have taken an oath not to reveal you need not state, but anything else that you have taken no oath not to reveal, I think you would be at liberty to tell." By the witness's daughter, - "At her age I don't think it is property that she should be asked these questions and annoyed in this way." By Mr. Kelley, - "We are not annoying her. We are handling her as gently as we know how, but we do insist that as the witness has been put on the witness stand and asked these questions that we be accorded a full and free opportunity to examine this witness as we deem proper, and if we cannot do it here, we shall ask that the witness's evidence be excluded from the record or the witness be brought to some proper place where we can examine her without these interruptions or promptings. We insist upon our right of cross examination, and I repeat to the witness the question."</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>891</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you still decline to answer the question?</question>
  <answer>I don't wish to tell anything more than is really necessary, and I don't think that is necessary.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>892</questionnumber>
  <question>So you decline to answer it do you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>893</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say at the same time that you have not taken any obligation not to tell it?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>894</questionnumber>
  <question>And the only reason you decline to tell it is because you don't think it is necessary?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I don't feel disposed to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>895</questionnumber>
  <question>And yet you have been sworn to tell the whole truth?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>896</questionnumber>
  <question>And you decline now to do it?</question>
  <answer>I don't decline to tell anything that I believe I ought to tell, -that anybody ought to require me to tell. I don't decline to do that. This is something though that I ought not to be required to tell.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>897</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is your reason for refusing to answer the question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I would like to ask you one question, and that is whether there is any more impropriety in my refusing to tell every little particular in these matters, than it is for a Mason to tell the particulars of the ceremonies that he sees?</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. E. L. Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>898</questionnumber>
  <question>You want us to believe your statement that they were the same?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>899</questionnumber>
  <question>Well we cannot accept your statement that they are the same unless that statement, nor would we believe anybody's insupported statement, unless we were permitted to esquire into it, and if you want us to believe it just answer out questions?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't answer that.</answer>

  <question>Now in answer to Mr. Hall's questions you answered that the ceremonies in Nauvoo in conferring those endowments were precisely the same as the ceremonies here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>901</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Now when you have done that you opened the door for cross examination, and that permits me to ask you what the ceremonies were here and there, and then it is for the court to say whether they are the

    </pagenumber>same, - it is for the court to say whether they are alike or not?
  </question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Cabell, - "I will ask the court through this examiner to apply the same rule that was applied in the case of the other witnesses, who were instructed that they were not required to reveal these ceremonies if they had promised or obligated themselves not to do so, when by answering questions such as has been asked this witness, they would be revealing any of the secret rules or practices of the church which they are obligated not to reveal." By Mr. P.P. Kelley, - "The Commissioner instructed the witnesses that they not reveal anything they had taken an obligation not to reveal, but this witness says she has not taken such an obligation, and declines to answer the question for the reason that in her opinion the answer it not pertinent to the issues, or is not "necessary" as she puts it. But let that pass."</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>902</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say that the Lord accepted your endowments that were performed outside of the temple in Nauvoo, just the same as if they had been performed in the temple? Is that what you say now?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I believe so. I believe that was what I said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>903</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you say so now?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>904</questionnumber>
  <question>And you believe that in the face of this revelation that I will read to you from exhibit "A" paragraph thirty seven, section one hundred and twenty four, on page one hundred and thirty three, - just get your book of Doctrine and Covenants and read that (witness gets book). Now read that.</question>
  <answer>Well I can't see any difference at all from what I have stated. It is the same as I stated I think, for I can't see any difference. I have stated over and over again that the Lord, - that it was revealed to Joseph that the Lord accepted of what we did outside of the temple when we did it. He accepted of it just the same as if we did it in the temple, - that is when we did it in a place that was dedicated, as we always did it in such a place. He accepted it just the same as if we did it in a temple, when we were dong the very best we could to build a temple. Of course he would not reject it, or deprive us of the right to do these things simply because we did not have a temple, and had not time to have built one, when we were doing our best to build one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>905</questionnumber>
  <question>And still you say that the Lord accepted of your endowments in the face of this revelation, which reads this way, - "And again verily I say unto you, how shall your washings be acceptable unto me, except you perform them in a house which you were built to my name." What do you say to that?</question>
  <answer>I say that is perfectly correct. That is correct, because he told Joseph the Prophet, that when we did not have a house erected in his name, that when we performed them outside of such a house in a place that was dedicated to this name that he would accept them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>906</questionnumber>
  <question>Who did he tell that to?</question>
  <answer>To Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>907</questionnumber>
  <question>Well hold on, -was Joseph Smith the prophet, above the law, - did he make the law?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir he made the church law, - that is the Lord made the law and Joseph wrote it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>908</questionnumber>
  <question>Well this that I have read was the law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>909</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Joseph could not make a law that was in conflict with that which I have read?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Not without he had the word of the Lord for it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>910</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Now I will read the next paragraph, - thirty eight of the same section but on the next page? It is as follows, -------- "For this cause I

    </pagenumber>commanded. Moses, that he should build a tabernacle, that they should bear it with them in the wilderness and to build a house in the land of promise, that those ordinances might be revealed that had been hid from before the world was. " What do you say to that?
  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is right, - that is correct.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>911</questionnumber>
  <question>Now the ordinances could not be revealed without the house, could they?</question>
  <answer>They could not be revealed to any individual outside of a house that had been dedicated for that purpose.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>912</questionnumber>
  <question>The temple was not finished then, was it?</question>
  <answer>No sir but it was being built just as fast as we were able to do it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>913</questionnumber>
  <question>Well there had not been any house built to the Lord at that time in Nauvoo, had there?</question>
  <answer>Well no sir, I think not, unless you would call the school house one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>914</questionnumber>
  <question>Well they were not built to the Lord?</question>
  <answer>What?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>915</questionnumber>
  <question>Your school houses?</question>
  <answer>Oh yes, they were. Every thing that we had was built to the Lord, you might say, and then we had meeting houses, and sometimes the school houses were used for that purpose.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>916</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes, I understand, but you did not get your endowments in your meeting houses?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>917</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you build your stores to the Lord anso?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but when we had a room that was used for the purpose of religious worship or these endowments, we always dedicated it to the Lord before we used it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>918</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was that store building built to the Lord?</question>
  <answer>I expect there was nothing done but what was done to the Lord amongst us as a people, for we always professed to do everything in the name of the Lord.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>919</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now look at paragraph forty of the same revelation, that reads as follows, - "And verily I say unto you, let this house be built unto my name, that I may reveal mine ordinances therein, unto my people." Do you recognize that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>920</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what do you say to that?</question>
  <answer>Well that is just right. That is all right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>921</questionnumber>
  <question>Now what house is that, - what house does that refer to?</question>
  <answer>That was the temple we were going to build and hadn't finished then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>922</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you want to go on record here as saying that the ordinances were revealed outside of this house?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>923</questionnumber>
  <question>Where were they revealed?</question>
  <answer>They were revealed in the rooms, - wherever we met, but the rooms were always dedicated to the Lord.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>924</questionnumber>
  <question>Were they revealed before the house was built?</question>
  <answer>I am sure I could not tell you anything about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>925</questionnumber>
  <question>now is that not the reason the temple was built here in Salt Lake City, so that the ordinances could be reveled in the temple?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>926</questionnumber>
  <question>They could not be revealed out on the street or in anybody else's house?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not when we had a temple.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>927</questionnumber>
  <question>Well they were not to be revealed were they, until after you had a temple, were they?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they could be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>928</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how do you know that, - what is your authority for the statement?</question>
  <answer>I told you several times that we received our endowments before we had a temple built. I have told you that several times.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>929</questionnumber>
  <question>The the Lord - revealed that wrong, didn't he?</question>
  <answer>What?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>930</questionnumber>
  <question>This revelation that I have read to you here, - or these paragraphs that I have read to you?</question>
  <answer>No sir, he revealed that to the prophet Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>931</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Well he revealed that before there was any house.

    </pagenumber>built to the Lord?
  </question>
  <answer>Well he revealed that to Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>932</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did the Lord reveal it to Joseph Smith outside of any house that was built to the Lord?</question>
  <answer>I suppose he did. I don't know, and never did, that these revelations had to come to the prophet inside a house built to the Lord.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>933</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did the Lord reveal to Joseph Smith that these endowments could be given in a house or room in a house that was not erected in his name?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I don't know that either. The prophet said they could be given, and he had it from the Lord, and they were given into these places I have told you of. I don't know what I could say more, for I have told you many times that wherever there was a room dedicated to the Lord, it was the Lord's.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>934</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now, is what you have testified to, all you know about the revealing of the ordinances?</question>
  <answer>I think so. It is all that I know, and I have told you so, but you want me to repeat it over and over again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>935</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you have been taught by the church out here that it referred to this?</question>
  <answer>To what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>936</questionnumber>
  <question>Excuse me, - should have said to these endowments?</question>
  <answer>How?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>937</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if you had not been taught by the church since you came here to Salt Lake that it referred to these endowments?</question>
  <answer>What does? 928 (The numbering started over again here - at 928 following 937)</answer>
  <question>This that I have been examining you about, and what I have read to you?</question>
  <answer>It always refers to endowments when it says "endowments."</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>929</questionnumber>
  <question>It always refers to the same one then it says endowments, does it?</question>
  <answer>I don't see how any other meaning can be got out of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>930</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it always refers to the same thing?</question>
  <answer>Of course it does.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>931</questionnumber>
  <question>When the endowment of the washing of feet, - of the feet, and anointing with oil, - when the revelations speaks about that, it refers to these same endowments does it not?</question>
  <answer>I can't tell you anything about that, for I don't know whether it does or not, but I suppose it does.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>932</questionnumber>
  <question>Well the fact is, is it not, that you don't know anything about that?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know what I do. I don't know that I can say anything about that, for I don't know that I can really say anything about something that I have not see.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>933</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now there was an ordinance on the washing with, - washing of the feet, and anointing with oil, was there not?</question>
  <answer>Well that was before I came into the church I suppose. Yes it was before I came into the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>934</questionnumber>
  <question>Did the Lord reveal that outside of the temple, or inside of the temple that was built to his name?</question>
  <answer>Well I expect it was since the temple was built perhaps.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>935</questionnumber>
  <question>Since the temple was built where?</question>
  <answer>At Kirtland.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>936</questionnumber>
  <question>Well don't you know it was revealed in the temple?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say as to that, but I have heard that it was, but of course I can't say, as I did not see it. I have been told that angels were there, and came and sat with them, and that the angels were outside of the temple.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>937</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you believe that?</question>
  <answer>I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>938</questionnumber>
  <question>You believe anything that you hear that came from any of the officers of the church? Is that not the fact?</question>

  <questionnumber>939</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you believe everything you heard Brigham Young teach, or preach wile he was President of the church, as well as everything that Wilford Woodruff tells you?</question>
  <answer>I believe everything that they say as the word of the Lord.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>940</questionnumber>
  <question>And it is a fact that when you are called on to repeat what they say as the word of the Lord, that you repeat it as the truth?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>941</questionnumber>
  <question>And what Joseph F. Smith tells you, you believe that too, as the truth, don't you?</question>
  <answer>I suppose when he says it is the word of the Lord on this or that, - I believe it when it comes that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>942</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you were baptized the second time when you came here to Salt Lake?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>943</questionnumber>
  <question>And you were baptized before you came here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>944</questionnumber>
  <question>How many times were you baptized before you came here?</question>
  <answer>For myself?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>945</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes, - how many times were you baptized for yourself?</question>
  <answer>Well I guess we were baptized when we first came out here, and then we at one time had a great, - what we called a reformation, and then we were all willing to be baptized ever again after that, - I mean at that time we were all willing to be baptized over again, so that we might start afresh again, and so we were all baptized at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>946</questionnumber>
  <question>You were all re-baptized in the reformation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. In the reformation we were all re-baptized I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>947</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know that you were all re-baptized?</question>
  <answer>I don't know of any that were not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>948</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you were all re-baptized in the reformation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>949</questionnumber>
  <question>And you were all baptized before that time when you first came here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>950</questionnumber>
  <question>That was before the reformation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>951</questionnumber>
  <question>You were baptized when you first came out here in the new and everlasting covenant?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>952</questionnumber>
  <question>Baptized in the one that is spoken of in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>In the revelation on plural marriage, - you were baptized into the new and everlasting covenant that is spoken of in the revelation on plural marriage?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, and for the further reason that the same matter was gone ever be counsel propounding the questions at the time that the witness was on the witness was on the witness stand here-to-fore.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>954</questionnumber>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  <question>Thee was not?</question>
  <answer>
    No sir, there was nothing said about plural marriage, particularly in our first baptism, because I supposed we were all professors of the religion, and we had a right to be baptized if we saw fit, and we saw fit to have it done. I told you plainly before that the reason we were baptized when we came here was because we had a hard journey of it and had come through many trying and perilous scenes on that rough journey we had across the plains, and some had been temped or provoked into using rough language to their cattle and so on, and we all felt that we should be re-baptized and repent of all that we had one that was not just according to the word of God. Now it was jut such things as
    <pagenumber>
      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0013-Pages_237-290-ORIGINAL/52.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 287</a>
    </pagenumber>that that made us feel that we should be re-baptized, and so we all concluded we would be baptized, and we were, but that was the reason of it.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>955</questionnumber>
  <question>And so the plural marriage covenant, - the new and everlasting covenant referred to in that revelation had nothing to do with it, had it?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>956</questionnumber>
  <question>Plural marriage had not as yet been announced to the church?</question>
  <answer>There was nothing said about plural marriage in that baptism, for it was for the purpose I have stated and nothing else, that we were baptized.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>957</questionnumber>
  <question>Plural marriage had not been announced publicly to the church until after that time, - it had not been announced at that time to the church publicly?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not say, - what time do you refer to. If you mean the time of the reformation I can only say that I don't know whether it was before and after the reformation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>958</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it was either before the reformation of just after you came down here?</question>
  <answer>No sir, - not plural marriage, - for I don't think that plural marriage was preached directly after we came here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>959</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it was preached in 1852, was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it was preached in 1852, but we came here in 1847, and that was several years before 1852.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>960</questionnumber>
  <question>now how long was it after you came here before they preached plural marriage, - before the church publicly preached plural marriage?</question>
  <answer>Well I have tried to find that out for myself, because when you were here the other day and asked me the questions I was afraid that maybe I had made a mistake, but by reckoning it from other things, I find out that the time that Orson Pratt preached that publicly on the stand, - the first time it had been so taught was in 1851. It was when your aunt died (speaking to her daughter who is sitting by the side of witness.) By witness's daughter, - "she died in 1852."</answer>
  <answer>Yes my dear I knew it was that time, for I remember that at the time I was waiting on her sick bed.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>961</questionnumber>
  <question>You remember the time by that fact?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for I was waiting on my sister at the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>962</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it was in 1852 that you first heard it preached.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>963</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was the time that the revelation on plural marriage was submitted by Brigham Young to the church for adoption?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I suppose so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>964</questionnumber>
  <question>And was it not on the same day that Orson Pratt preached that sermon, - that is the same day and in the same building and at the time that Brigham Young submitted the purported revelation to the church for adoption?</question>
  <answer>I don't know. I really cannot say as to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>965</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is your best recollection as to that?</question>
  <answer>I can't say, but I presume it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>966</questionnumber>
  <question>You were present when it was presented to the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I was not. I was absent waiting on my sick sister at the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>967</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Now the new and everlasting covenant that was mentioned at that time, - that is, that is mentioned in the revelation on plural marriage, is the same new and everlasting covenant into which you were baptized on your coming to Salt Lake? Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked

    </pagenumber>the witness for the reason "that the witness has already stated that it was not the new and everlasting covenant referred to in the revelation on plural marriage that they were baptized into on coming to the territory of Utah."
  </question>
  <answer>No sir, there was nothing but just what I have told you about it. That was the reason we were baptized on account of the hardships we had come through, and the difficulties we had encountered, and it was for the purpose of remitting any sins what we had committed by reason of the privations we had endured or the provocations we had et with, that we concluded to be baptized , and the question of the plural marriage had nothing to do with it. It is a very simply thing and I think you ought to understand it easily.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>968</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were you re-baptized again in the reformation of 1857?</question>
  <answer>In 1857?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>969</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes ma'am? That is when the reformation took pace, -in 1857, was it not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for that was when we just got here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>970</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't comprehend the question, -you got here in 1847 and I am asking you about 1857 now, -I mean the reformation of 1857?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that was when it was, that was ten years later.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>971</questionnumber>
  <question>Now when were you re-baptized in the reformation?</question>
  <answer>Well it was in 1857 I suppose, it was at the same time as the rest of them, anyway.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>972</questionnumber>
  <question>Now why were you re-baptized in the reformation, or what is called "reformation" in 1857?</question>
  <answer>Why?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>973</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes, -was it not because of the new and everlasting covenant that is mentioned in that revelation?</question>
  <answer>I don't believe that it was, because I believe,-</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>974</questionnumber>
  <question>You would not say it was not, would you?</question>
  <answer>Well I would not swear either one way or the other, because I can't bring it to my mind as to how that was either one way or the other. I can't bring that to my mind one way or the other.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>975</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you have taken endowments in Nauvoo, and in Salt Lake City, -you have taken them in both places?</question>
  <answer>Oh, yes.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>976</questionnumber>
  <question>Now madam, I will show this book marked exhibit "D" and ask you to look at the first two or three or four pages in it, and I will ask you if that is the endowment ceremony that was used at Nauvoo at the time you took your endowments?</question>
  <answer>(witness examines book) I can't say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>977</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you know anything bout that?</question>
  <answer>I supposed I do, but I can't see this even with my glasses on.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>978</questionnumber>
  <question>You can see the picture there , ca't you?</question>
  <answer>I can see something.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>979</questionnumber>
  <question>Can't you see the pictures there?</question>
  <answer>I can see some thing, I say, but I can't tell what it is. I can see something, but I can't tell what it is or what it means.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>980</questionnumber>
  <question>You never saw any such things as is represented by these pictures in taking your endowments in Nauvoo, did you?</question>

  <mono>By Mr. Southern, "Let him read all of it". By Mr. Kelley,</mono>

  <question>Very well, read it all.</question>
  <answer>"Quite a discussion followed concerning the right of the chair to appoint an absent brother, and one who if present would not be an ex-officio member of the conference. The chair held that he was right. His decision was appealed from, but the body sustained the chair."</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>17</questionnumber>
  <question>I had you read that as he wanted it read, so that there would be no occasion to go over it on cross examination, as Mr. Stebbins is very anxious to get away from here as soon as he possibly can.

  <questionnumber>19</questionnumber>
  <question>Within the United States I mean Mr. Stebbins?</question>
  <answer>About four hundred who are now existing as organization, besides one hundred and fifty that are more or less in a disorganized state, by reason of removal or departure of officers for other locations, about four hundred are now existing as organized bodies with officers and holding regular sessions or meetings.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>20</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know about the membership in the United States?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir approximately I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>21</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about what is it?</question>
  <answer>From twenty two thousand and to twenty five thousand, - from twenty two thousand I would say to twenty five thousand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>22</questionnumber>
  <question>I will get you to state Mr Stebbins, if you know, how many of the principle officers of the reorganized church, - I mean to say how many of the principle officers of the original church, or organization, the church organization, - founded in 1830, afterwards united with the reorganization?</question>
  <answer>Do I know about how many of them?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>23</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>24</questionnumber>
  <question>Well give the offices that they held in the original church?</question>
  <answer>My knowledge is derived from personal acquaintance and the records of the church. Now by knowledge that I have received from various sources there was a good many who had belonged to the original church at Nauvoo that united with the reorganization, - there was the President of the stake there at Nauvoo, - I mean to say the President of the high council there at Nauvoo, - one of the quorom of twelve, and at least twenty one of the high priests, eighteen of the quorom of seventy, and at least from two hundred to three hundred, and perhaps more of the elders, - to say nothing of the lesser priesthood as they are called, - priests, teachers, and deacons.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>25</questionnumber>
  <question>Mr Stebbins can you give in round numbers the number of persons that belonged to the original church that afterwards became identified with the reorganized church? Now I am calling for both officers and members, both the people or simple laity and the officers of the original church, who afterwards became associated and identified with the reorganized church?</question>
  <answer>Well I would consider that it would be within bounds, and upon this I speak in reference to the officers also. Now so far as my acquaintance leads or goes of course I do not profess to have full knowledge except from the records, and the knowledge on the matter that has come to me in connection with my official connection with the church from correspondence, etc. and in that way, and also by individual information, - I think it would be safely within bounds to say from three to five thousand as the number. That is to say from three thousand to five thousand of the members who belonged to the original church, united with the reorganization from 1853 down to the present time at different times during that period. And I will say further that they are still uniting with the reorganized church. Now there may have been more than that, but I do not wish to state with any greater degree than certainty, - of certainty than I have as to the number, neither would I say that there was that many, but that is my judgement from my acquaintance and the records and correspondence I have had.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>26</questionnumber>
  <question>And that would be from three thousand to five thousand in your best opinion?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>27</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I would ask you Mr Stebbins if this exhibit marked Exhibit N, has been in you possession as seretary and recorder of the church since you have held that office?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>51</questionnumber>
  <question>It will be eighteen years ago this next April since this record came into your hands?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>52</questionnumber>
  <question>What year was that?</question>
  <answer>1874.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>53</questionnumber>
  <question>When was that record made, - that is when was it written there?</question>
  <answer>Well that I do not know, but I suppose at the time of the reorganization of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>54</questionnumber>
  <question>In 1852?</question>
  <answer>In 1853 the church was reorganized.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>55</questionnumber>
  <question>In 1853?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and this is the minutes of 1857.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>56</questionnumber>
  <question>That is in 1857, - that record is for 1857?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I suppose the record was written then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>57</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say this record you suppose was written in 1857, and the records that contain it did not come into your possession until 1874?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>58</questionnumber>
  <question>And that record remained in the condition in which it was originally written from 1857 down to 1874 the time that it first came into your possession?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - from the time it was written whenever that was, down to the time I got it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>59</questionnumber>
  <question>It remained in that condition without being changed.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>60</questionnumber>
  <question>And you changed it?</question>
  <answer>I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>61</questionnumber>
  <question>Why did you change it?</question>
  <answer>Well I did not change it to any material extent. I did not change it with the exception of striking out hte letter "s". The writting or ink with which it was written was dim, and although it could be seen I did not think it made any difference in striking out that letter "s" for the reason that that was the way the word or name was spelled, and I did not think there would ever be any question on that point at all, so I struck it out, for it was evidently an error on the part of the secretary who compiled the record in writing it that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>62</questionnumber>
  <question>You assumed that there was an error in the original writing and took upon your self the authority to change it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. There was no object in writing over it at that time other than the correction of the error in the spelling, and tracing the name over again in ink that could be readily seen. The original writing can to some extent be seen there yet as for instance the top part of the "K", as can be portions of all the letters composing the name in the original writing. It was rather dim as I have stated, and there being no question, or prospect of a question being raised about it I wrote it over again, understanding the name was Hedrick instead of Hedricks".</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>63</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I would like you to state if you can about what time you did that?</question>
  <answer>I believe it was not less that 10 years ago.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>64</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you do that by order of the conference?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>65</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you do it by order of anybody?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>66</questionnumber>
  <question>You just did it upon your own motion?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>67</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you taken care of all the other parts of that record in the same way as you have done that?</question>
  <answer>I have taken care of it to the best of my ability, - that part and all the rest.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>68</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you made any other changes in that record aside from that change?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I have</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>69</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you would know it if you had, wouldn't you?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>70</questionnumber>
  <question>The records were in your possession?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I would know by examination if I had.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>71</questionnumber>
  <question>But you do not know from memory whether you did or not?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>72</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say, I believe, that you struck out an "s" there?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>73</questionnumber>
  <question>In the name?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>74</questionnumber>
  <question>And what did you do that for?</question>
  <answer>So it would agree with the resolution following exonerating Jason W. Briggs from acting with Granville Hedrick, where the name is "Hedricks."</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>75</questionnumber>
  <question>If you struck out the "s" there it does not agree.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it does not agree, that is true.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>76</questionnumber>
  <question>It does not agree with the resolution then?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not altogether. It does excepting in that respect.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, did you change any other word in that record in 1857?</question>
  <answer>No, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>78</questionnumber>
  <question>Why didn't you?</question>
  <answer>Well, I had no other reason that I know of to change it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>79</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then, on your direct examination you turned over to page thirty-nine and referred to that did you not?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>80</questionnumber>
  <question>And explained that was another record there?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>81</questionnumber>
  <question>You explained there was another record of the same thing on page thirty-nine?</question>
  <answer>I was asked in my direct examination if there was another copy of that record there, and I said there was substantially a copy of it there, and read it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>82</questionnumber>
  <question>You stated there was another copy there?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>83</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you state that that copy of the record had been erased?</question>
  <answer>No, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>84</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you state there had been a line drawn through it from top to bottom?</question>
  <answer>No, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>85</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not state anything about this?</question>
  <answer>No, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>86</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, is it not a fact that there is a line drawn through it from top to bottom?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>87</questionnumber>
  <question>Now, why did you not state that there was a line drawn through it showing that there was an erasure?</question>
  <answer>Well, I was not asked the question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>88</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you state that record was not signed and certified?</question>
  <answer>No, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>89</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the fact, is it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>90</questionnumber>
  <question>Why did you not state that?</question>
  <answer>Well, I was not asked the question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>91</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now, if that's an erased record, why did you read from it at all?</question>
  <answer>Why did I read from it? Simply because I was asked to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>92</questionnumber>
  <question>Let me look at that for a moment, please.</question>
  <answer>Here it is. (Witness hands counsel for the defense the record regarding which he is testfying.)</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>93</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you have stated, I believe, that on page forty-one is a reference in a resolution numbered third to the same name as it appeared on page thirty-seven, changed as has been stated, have you not?</question>
  <answer>I read it as I was requested to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>94</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you not stated there was a reference there to the name?</question>
  <answer>I so understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>95</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you so understand it?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>96</questionnumber>
  <question>Now how do you know it?</question>
  <answer>Do I say that I know it, or knew it?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>97</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, I ask you if you know it.</question>
  <answer>I answer that I do not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>98</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not now say that you do know it?</question>
  <answer>No, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>99</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, what do you say about it?</question>
  <answer>I say just this in regard to it: that the record that follows exonerates J. W. Briggs from acting in that capacity to which he was appointed at the previous conference.</answer>

    </pagenumber>previous conference?
  </question>
  <answer>It so says.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>101</questionnumber>
  <question>Where?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason it does not call for the best evidence.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>102</questionnumber>
  <question>Where does it say that?</question>
  <answer>Right there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>103</questionnumber>
  <question>Does it make any reference to the previous resolution?</question>
  <answer>It doesn't have to, for the resolution speaks for itself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>104</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, I know that. I will ask you not to look at the third resolution of which you have been speaking, and say if there is enough in that to carry out your opinion?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it does not call for the best evidence as the resolution speaks for itself as to its contents and meaning, and the question asked the witness calls for his opinion.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>105</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question? Have you given all the answer you want to give to that question?</question>
  <answer>I don't see how I can make it any clearer by answering further.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>106</questionnumber>
  <question>You have given all the answer you can to that question then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>From whom did you receive that record?</question>
  <answer>I received it from the hands of the family of the original, - that is I should say I received it from the family, or the church did, of the former recorder of the church, Mr Isaac Sheen, who died just two days before the sitting of the conference of 1874, and it was in the hands of his family with the church records, and before the close of that conference I was appointed church recorder, and not a great while afterwards the records were delivered into my hands.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>108</questionnumber>
  <question>Who composed his family?</question>
  <answer>The family of Mr Sheen?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>109</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well he had a wife and two daughters and a son.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>110</questionnumber>
  <question>How old was the son at the time?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I can tell you just how old he was at that time, but it was some where near manhood, or about the beginning of manhood.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>111</questionnumber>
  <question>From whose hands in that family did you receive that record?</question>
  <answer>Directly from their hands do you mean?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>112</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>I think they were not delivered directly into my hands, but were turned over to the church through a process of law and were received by the officers of the church, - They were received I think by the officers of the law at first and by the officers of the law turned over into the hands of the officers of the church, and by them delivered to me.</answer>

  <question>Then if that be the case Mr Stebbins why did you state a moment ago that you received them directly from the hands of the family of Mr Sheen?</question>
  <answer>Well I probably stated that without a thought of the fact that there was a process of law in relation to the matter. It did not matter much for I was the succeeding recorder of the church and I suppose I meant with out thing of the fact to state that they passed into the hands, - directly into my hands as the successor of Mr Sheen. I had no intention for a moment of misleading anyone, but meant that I received them as the successor, and without any thought of the process of law that was had there to get possession of the records.</answer>

  <answer>Well for the reason that the church like any other corporation or body has a right to its own records, - its own books of record and property, and after the death of Isaac Sheen, the church through its officers, made request of his family for these records, and a refusal was made to the demand or request to give them up, and when the proper request had been made, and had been met with a refusal to give them up, then the church by its Bishop at that time, cause a paper to be got up, and demand made for them by the proper officer of the law, and then they were delivered to the officer, and so the church came into possession of them again.</answer>

  <question>Well doubless you intended that as an answer to my question, but I do not consider that it is an aswer, though I do not believe that you purposely avoid answering it. What I wanted to inquire about was the grounds upon which they based that refusal?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds that it is irrelevant and immeterial, and not cross examination.</mono>

  <answer>There was something due Mr Sheen at the time of his death, but the promise or agreement was made that this should all be settled upon information or bill presented for acceptance or payment by the church through its proper officer, the bishop.

  <questionnumber>200</questionnumber>
  <question>Oow many?</question>
  <answer>Seven quoroms of seventy, but that number is not compulsory. The statement of the law is in words to that effect, - that the number of the seventies may be increased to seven quoroms. It gives the privelege of having that many quoroms but does not state that there shall be that many as an law binding or obligatory on the church. It states that there may seven quoroms of seventy each, but does not state that that shall be the case.</answer>

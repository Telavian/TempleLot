  <questionnumber>1</questionnumber>
  <question>Before proceeding with the cross examination of Mr. Hill, I have a notion to make to the following effect, Plaintiff now moves the Court to exclude from the record all the tax receipts offered in evidence here-to-fore on behalf of the defendants, for the reason that they show on their face that the property which they purport to be the receipts for taxes paid thereon, was not liable to taxation, being church property.</question>

  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>

  <question>Is it not true that you never were baptized but the one time?</question>
  <answer>I decline to answer that question.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons above set forth.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>37</questionnumber>
  <question>Will you answer the question? I insist that you answer the question.</question>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "I insist that it has nothing to do with this case, - that it has nothing to do with this case, - that it is not pertinent to any of the issues in this case, and the witness declines to answer it. Now if you have anything to do with the witness just go ahead and do it." By Mr. Kelley, - "Let the record show this, that with our waiving our rights to have the question answered, I will not insist upon the question." By Mr. Southern, - "I think it is wholly un-important in this case, and has no possible bearing on the case, nevertheless I will advise you Mr. Hill if you have no other reasons than what you have stated to answer the question. I don't see that it does any harm or cuts any figure one way or the other."</mono>
  <answer>Well I think best not to answer it.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Kelley, -</mono>

    </pagenumber>thing, -I have not objection to the record showing the facts, but that is not a statement of what actually occurred. I told the witness to answer the question."
  </mono>
  <answer>It is not necessary for any one to tell me when to answer a question, I know when to answer questions without being told to do so.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "Mr. Notary let the record show just what the attorney, myself included, says, and on that I am willing to stand." By the Notary, - "That is just what it shows, - what is said in the exact language, and credited to the party using it, whether it is attorney or witness." By Mr. Southern, - "Well that is satisfactory." By Mr. Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>44</questionnumber>
  <question>Well answer the question?</question>
  <answer>What is the question? I have forgotten it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>45</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you when you united with the defendant church in this case?</question>
  <answer>Well, -</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "Now the attorney for the defendants objects to all this line of examination, because it is not cross examination, with reference to any matter brought out in the examination in chief, - as I only examined Mr. Hill with reference to these tax receipts, and nothing else, and I object to it further on the ground that it is wholly immaterial to any issue in this case. Now you may answer the question Mr Hill.</mono>
  <answer>I consider that I became acquainted with this church that you call the defendant church, when I first joined the church in England in 1848.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>46</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the way you look at it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is the way I consider it, for I consider that it is the same church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>47</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you unite with it?</question>
  <answer>In 1848.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>48</questionnumber>

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>50</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you at any other time?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>51</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever at any other time unite with the defendant church except at the time in 1848, as you have here-to-fore stated?</question>
  <answer>I can't say that I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>52</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you say that I did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I can't say that I did or did not, for I claim that the church that I am not associated with is a part and parcel of the church that I first associated myself with in 1848.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>53</questionnumber>
  <question>You claim that you are a member of the same church now that you associated yourself with, or joined in 1848?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>That is your claim?</question>

  <questionnumber>55</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you not baptized into the defendant church after 1848?</question>
  <answer>I decline to answer.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>56</questionnumber>
  <question>For what reason do you decline to answer?</question>
  <answer>Because it did not have anything to do with the case at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>57</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your reason, and your only reason for declining to answer the question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I don't consider that the face of whether I was baptized or not baptized cuts any figure whatever.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>58</questionnumber>
  <question>You do?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I do, - it don't make any difference whether I was baptized once or a hundred times that I can see. Many people are baptized many times.</answer>

  <answer>For the reason I stated before.</answer>

  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "The defendants' attorney desires to object here, to this line of examination being extended any farther than it has been, on the ground that it is not responsive to any testimony produced or given by this witness in his examination in chief, and because the plaintiffs have had a remedy, and a way to obtain this testimony by a proper examination of their own in chief." By Mr. Kelley, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>76</questionnumber>

  <question>Was he anything else?</question>
  <answer>Not that I know of. I don't remember whether he was or not.</answer>

  <question>Well he was made President by the defendant church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>100</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he made prophet, seer and revelator?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't think he was, I believe a man, - I believe he might be that, but I don't believe that man can make a man a prophet, seer and revelator.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>101</questionnumber>
  <question>Well in the ordination of Granville Hedrick, was he not ordained to be a prophet, seer and revelator?</question>
  <answer>I can't say about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>102</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know about that?</question>
  <answer>No sir. There might have been some such words used, but there was no understanding that the man who ordained him had any authority to ordain him a prophet, seer and revelator.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>103</questionnumber>
  <question>There was no authority to ordain him in that capacity?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, he could be, but it could not be done by a man agency as I understand it. No man had any authority to ordain him in that way, although he might have used the words.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>104</questionnumber>
  <question>Did not Granville Hedrick, after his ordination, and while he was President of the church, publish the fact of his ordination, and state that he was ordained a prophet, seer and revelator? Did he not after his ordination so claim the fact to be?</question>
  <answer>No sir, he did not claim any such thing I believe, but others might have claimed it for him, but if they did I don't think he consented to any such a thing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>105</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you say he did not publish it?</question>
  <answer>I don't think he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>106</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you say he did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I say I don't think he did. I am quite sure he did not, but others might have done it without his knowledge, for I believe he never authorized any one to make any such claim on his behalf. I don't think he ever consented to any such thing if it was done. Others may have done it, but he did not consent to it, and I do not by any means say it was not done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>Look at the pamphlet I now hand you and see if you can identify it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

    </pagenumber>remember all in a moment the names of all the members of the church, and I don't think I should be expected to remember them, for it is almost an impossibility to do so, even for a person with the best memory.

    <question>Because they would not comply with the rule on dress?</question>

    </pagenumber>
    <question>You think it could?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>495</questionnumber>
    <question>That is, you think the charge against a member of the church could maintain a specification regarding the matter of dress, even though the question if dress was not a rule of the church?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>496</questionnumber>
    <question>The it is a fact that in the defendant church members can be charged with misdemeanors that are not against the rules of the church, and can be expelled from the church on that account? Is that what I understand you to say?</question>
    <answer>Well no. I don't say that.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>497</questionnumber>
    <question>Well what do you say about it?</question>
    <answer>I don't think they can be expelled for that. I don't think that is so, but they can be charged with conduct that the church thinks is unbecoming if it is taken in connection with violation of specific rules of the church, while in itself this conduct would not cause them to be expelled, still it can be considered in connection with other offences against the rules of the church. They cannot be expelled unless there is rules or something to that effect governing the matter.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>498</questionnumber>
    <question>Well if there were members expelled with charges against them for not complying with the rules relating to dress, it would be because of the rule of the church on that subject would it not?</question>

    <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it calls in the first place for an opinion of the witness, and in the second place because it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and in the third place because it is not a cross examination.</mono>

    <question>Answer the question?</question>
    <answer>I don't hardly know how to answer that question.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>500</questionnumber>
    <question>Well, if members had been expelled, or have been expelled from the defendant church, where the charge has been disobeying the rule or usage in regard to dress, it would be because the church had established such a rule would it not?</question>
    <answer>I don't think anybody has been discharged for that matter. I think the ones that have been disfellowshipped have been so treated because of other things. I don't think the matter of dress was the cause of their being disfellowshipped.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>501</questionnumber>
    <question>Well that is hardly an answer to my question. I will repeat my question, - if members have been expelled from the church to which you belong, where the charge has been disobeying the rule or usage of the church in regard to dress, it would be because the church had established that rule, wouldn't it?</question>
    <answer>Well not necessarily.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>502</questionnumber>
    <question>It would be for that and other things together?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>503</questionnumber>
    <question>That would be the way it would be?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir, and I think it has been for that and other things together, but for me to testify what it was in any individual case I could not do it, for I don't remember.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>504</questionnumber>
    <question>Were not Franklyn and his wife disfellowshipped for refusing to comply with that particular rule, and for nothing else?</question>
    <answer>No sir, I don't think it was for that and nothing else. I think there was other things.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>505</questionnumber>
    <question>Do you know what the other things were?</question>
    <answer>No sir.</answer>

    <answer>I don't remember.</answer>

    <answer>Yes sir, I say there was no rule of the church that prescribed it, - it was simply advisory, - they were not to be forced to conform to it unless they saw fit. It was left to the individuals to decide for themselves what they should wear.</answer>

    <question>Why did you charhge a man with rebellion when he was violating no rule of the church?</question>

    <question>I asked you if you were just as positive of the fact that Mrs. Haldeman was not excluded for the same reason and for nothing else?</question>

  <questionnumber>535</questionnumber>
    <question>Do you know why she withdrew?</question>
    <answer>No sir. I don't know anything about it. She just withdrew and did not tell me why she withdrew, and I never had any talk with her on the subject.</answer>

  <questionnumber>536</questionnumber>
    <question>You said I believe before we adjourned for noon, that you did not know why Mrs. Haldeman withdrew?</question>
    <answer>No sir, she did not tell me anything about her reasons that I remember anything about. Now before you ask me any further question I want to say that there are several matters that I did not fully understand when you questioned me regarding them, and I have though of them since and want them corrected on the record. One was in regard, -</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>537</questionnumber>
    <question>Well that may be done by questions asked by your attorney on your re-examination?</question>
    <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "Let the objection you wish to make go on the record if you want it, to the witness to explain anything, but the witness has the right to make any explanations he sees fit here and now. I have always found it best and allowable to allow the witness to make his corrections at the time if he thinks best, and he can make his correction ow if he has mis-state anything. I am sure I don't know what he is going to state."</mono>
    <answer>Well it was in relation to Mrs. Franklin, -</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>538</questionnumber>
    <question>Well what is it?</question>
    <answer>
      If I understood it correctly I understood Mr. Kelley to say or ask me if they dis-fellowshipped and I said they were. Well I was mistaken in that, for they were not dis-fellowshipped but withdrew. Now that is the facts in relation to them; and another thing is in relation to Daniel Border and his wife who were members. If they were members I have forgotten the fact, but his wife is not a member at the present. His wife is not

      </pagenumber>a member of the church at the present time, but my recollection of my testimony is that I gave you to understand that she was, but when I come to refresh my recollection I know she is not a member. Now that is the correction I wish to make together with the correction regarding the Franklins, for they withdrew and were not disfellowshipped. The question was a little past my memory so as to be able to answer it at the time it was asked correctly, but when I come to look it over I remember that they were not disfellowshipped but withdrew. I can't think of all these things off hand, so as to answer them without reflection, but I have done the best I could under the circumstances. Now that is not all for I made a in regard to Soehle. I stated that his family were disfellowshipped. Now that is not the truth, for they were partly disfellowshipped, and partly they withdrew.
    </answer>
    <mono>By Mr. Kelley,</mono>
    
  <questionnumber>539</questionnumber>
    <question>Some were disfellowshipped?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir, and some others of the family withdrew. Now that is all I wish to state now by way of explanation, further than to say that the Haldeman's were in the same way, some of them were disfellowshipped and some of them withdrew, and if in my prior testimony I failed to make that statement with reference to the ones that withdrew and the ones that were disfellowshipped I do it now. Perhaps I did not state how many withdrew and how many were disfellowshipped, and that is the reason that I make this statement now. I do not know of anything further that I can say by way of explanation. These questions were asked so quick, one after another, that I could not answer them definitely as I would like to have done, and did not know it was necessary, particularly necessary that I should do so.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>540</questionnumber>
    <question>Is that all?</question>
    <answer>That is all the correction I wish to make.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>541</questionnumber>
    <question>During the intermission have you refreshed you recollection sufficiently to be able to state the exact number of members that belong to the branch of the defendant church here at Independence?</question>
    <answer>No sir, but I believe I can come pretty near it. Now I wish to say that you asked me that before, and it was one of the questions which I think I did not understand you in. I supposed you asked me how many members there was of the church. I did not understand you to say the branch. I don't know whether you asked me that or not, but I think now that was the question you asked me.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>542</questionnumber>
    <question>I asked you both questions, first I asked you with reference to the church, and then with reference to the branch? I will ask you how many members there are in the branch?</question>
    <answer>Well I believe as near as I can remember in the branch here there is about twelve or thirteen members. Now that is my opinion, for I cannot say positively as I have not counted the members in the branch.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>543</questionnumber>

And the plaintiffs further deny that their cross examination of this witness made him their witness, or that their examination partook of the nature of direct examination."

  <questionnumber>864</questionnumber>
    <question>Then you acknowledge that you don't know anything about it?</question>
    <answer>I understand that it is a part and parcel of the church that was organized in 1830, but I don't know how you would apply the connection between this and the original church.

  <questionnumber>865</questionnumber>
    <question>Have you not frequently, here in Independence, both publicly and privately stated that this was a branch of the original church, and nothing more?</question>

  <questionnumber>866</questionnumber>

    <answer>Well I don't think we are the whole church.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>868</questionnumber>
    <question>Well do you claim or believe that you are a part of it?</question>
    <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is not cross examination, irrelevant and immaterial, and calling for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
    <answer>Well if you dissect it that way it would be so. I don't know what you mean though.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>869</questionnumber>
    <question>Well you do not claim that these then or thirteen members out here at Bonner Springs is the whole church of course?</question>
    <answer>No sir.</answer>

    <answer>No sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>873</questionnumber>
    <question>It is called a branch too, is it not?</question>
    <answer>Well I really do not know what is the proper way to designate these things, but that is probably so.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>874</questionnumber>
    <question>Now the church here at Independence is a branch then?</question>
    <answer>I can't say. If you choose to call it that, do so, - I have no objection.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>875</questionnumber>
    <question>Well if it is a branch was it not a branch before the organization of the branch down at Bonner Springs?</question>
    <answer>Well I reckon that is so.</answer>

    <answer>The original church that was established in 1830?</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>878</questionnumber>
    <question>Yes sir?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir, for if believing in the same doctrines would make it that, it could probably be called that.</answer>

    <question>Well is that not what it would be?</question>
    <answer>I reckon so.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>880</questionnumber>
    <question>So that the church here in Independence is a branch of the church that was organized in 1830 by Joseph Smith, the seer?</question>
    <answer>If we believe in the principles of the same doctrines that he taught at that time, and we claim to do that, why then it might be called a branch, but as I said before I do not know how to designate these terms, for I am not a lawyer, nor yet am I a scholar.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>881</questionnumber>
    <question>Then do I understand you to say that the defendant church here in Independence is a branch, and as a branch accepts and believes in and teaches and practices the same tenets, doctrines and beliefs that was taught and practiced by Joseph Smith in the church organized in the year 1830, by Joseph Smith the seer?</question>

  <questionnumber>882</questionnumber>
    <question>I asked you if I understood you to say that the defendant church, - that is the church here at Independence, of which you are a member and the bishop, is a branch of the church organized in 1830 by Joseph Smith, and as a branch of that church accepts and believes in and teaches and practices the same tenets, doctrines and beliefs that were taught and practiced in the church organized in the year 1830 by Joseph Smith, the prophet and seer?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir, to a limited extent.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>883</questionnumber>
    <question>To what extent?</question>
    <answer>We believe in the doctrines that were taught in the church in the first two or three years after its organization, but then after that we claim that it fell away from grace, and we do not follow it in its apostacy. We believe in what it taught in the first two or three years after it existence, but we do not believe in all that it taught right along, and don't accept that by any means.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>884</questionnumber>
    <question>Then you repudiate what the church taught after the first two or three years of its existence?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>885</questionnumber>
    <question>When was that repudiation made?</question>
    <answer>Why we have made it at least from the year fifty and perhaps before that. I was not with the church, - that is I was not present at the time that the first repudiation was made, but I understand that it was as early as the year 1850 and perhaps earlier. 886 (This question and answer are missing)</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>887</questionnumber>
    <question>What did you do towards repudiating anything before the year 1850?</question>
    <answer>What did we do?</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>888</questionnumber>
    <question>Yes sir?</question>
    <answer>We declared our disbelief of some of the doctrines that wee taught and advocated.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>889</questionnumber>
    <question>You were an elder in the church in 1849, were you not?</question>

    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>892</questionnumber>
    <question>Now with whom did you meet at that time that belonged to the church?</question>
    <answer>Oh, I can't tell, that was so long ago.</answer>
    <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "All this line of examination is objected to because it is not justified by any rule of examination, direct or cross, or of re-examination, therefore it is objected to." By Mr. Kelley, -</mono>
    
  <questionnumber>893</questionnumber>
    <question>With whom did you meet in 1849, if any body, that is in church fellowship?</question>

    <question>Mr. Hill did I understand you to say that you accepted as true all the revelations given prior to 1833?</question>
    <answer>If you so understood me you understood me different from what I intended. I said I accepted and believed the revelations, not mean all of them however, that were given from '29 up to '33 and possibly '34.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>995</questionnumber>
    <question>Well now can you state what ones you believe and what ones you do not believe?</question>
    <answer>Well I can't exactly remember, but there is a good many that I don't exactly believe in.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>996</questionnumber>
    <question>Well I mean the ones given from 1929 to 1833 or '34, - what revelations given during that time do you not accept as correct?</question>
    <answer>Well, ---I don't know what you mean.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>997</questionnumber>
    <question>I understood you to say, - if I understood you correctly, - that the Hedrickite church repudiated some of the revelations, - in fact all of them, that were given subsequent to 1834, and that is the point at which they split from the rest of the believers in Joseph Smith? Now is that right?</question>
    <answer>No not exactly.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>998</questionnumber>
    <question>Now what revelations do you refer to that you do not believe in that were given prior to 1833? Can't you mention one of them?</question>
    <answer>I don't remember but there are, - there is one or two that we don't know whether they are true, or not true, and we neither accept nor reject them.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>999</questionnumber>
    <question>Now can you tell what they are and the date of them?</question>
    <answer>No sir, not now.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1000</questionnumber>
    <question>Or what they refer to?</question>
    <answer>No sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1001</questionnumber>
    <question>You cannot tell that?</question>
    <answer>No sir, not exactly.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1002</questionnumber>
    <question>Do I understand you to say that you cannot tell either what they refer to or the dates at which they were given, - that is the revelations that you rejent that were given prior to 1833?</question>
    <answer>No sir, I can't do it now.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1003</questionnumber>
    <question>Are they in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir, I think they are. They are all in there.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1004</questionnumber>
    <question>Well then you spoke of having read the book of doctrine and covenants before coming here, did you at any time repudiate any of them before coming here?</question>
    <answer>Any of what?</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1005</questionnumber>
    <question>Any of the revelations before coming here?</question>
    <answer>Any that was contained in the book?</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1006</questionnumber>
    <question>Yes sir, did you at that time repudiate any of the revelations, - that is before you came here, did you at any time repudiate any of the revelations that were contained in the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
    <answer>I don't know what you mean, -</answer>

  <questionnumber>1007</questionnumber>
    <question>Of course I know that you repudiated the revelations that were given after 1833,-it is the ones prior to that time I refer to?</question>
    <answer>Well I don't understand that we repudiate them all,-we think they are liable to criticism, and we look upon them with suspicion that were given after that time. There was some that we did not undestand and wer just took them at what they were worth,-not rejecting them or accepting them,-we did not take them as correct or as false.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1008</questionnumber>
    <question>You believe all these revelations with reference to Zion. You believe in these and accept them as correct, do you not?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir, partly,-not all of them, but part of them we do.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1009</questionnumber>
    <question>You give them a qualified approval by way of accepting them?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1010</questionnumber>
    <question>In what part do you not approve?</question>
    <answer>I believe them like this as far as I understand them. I did not claim to have a correct understanding of all that, and I don't claim to have a correct understanding now.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1011</questionnumber>
    <question>Well there is one thing that you do understand do you not, and that is that this place here was appointed as a gathering place for the saints?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1012</questionnumber>
    <question>You believe that revelation?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1014</questionnumber>
    <question>Well now that revelation speaks of a gathering place for the saints,-it speaks of the gathering of the saints, and a place for the erection of the temple, does it not?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1015</questionnumber>
    <question>And that you believe of course?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1016</questionnumber>
    <question>Well now if you believe that, you believe that it came as a direct revelation from God?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1017</questionnumber>
    <question>You believe that?</question>
    <answer>Certainly.</answer>

    <question>Through Joseph Smith, the prophet and seer?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1019</questionnumber>
    <question>Do you believe that is a revelation from God?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1020</questionnumber>
    <question>Then when that revelation says that the place for the temple is westward from the Court house, what do you understand by it?</question>
    <answer>What do I understand by it?</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1021</questionnumber>
    <question>Yes sir?</question>
    <answer>I understand by it just what it says. I think it is plain enough.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1022</questionnumber>
    <question>That that was the place selected by God and designated by him through the revelation given by him through Joseph Smith, as the place for the temple?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>1023</questionnumber>
    <question>So when you came here from Wisconsin you were like many others who had come here before you did, anxious to see the place which was suppose to be sacred ground?</question>
    <answer>Well I don't know about that. I don't know that I was so terrible anxious.</answer>

  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the last five questions asked the witness, and especially to the last one, on the ground that the same question has been asked the witness three or four times, and the witness has replied that he cannot state the year, and on the further ground that the examination is improper in-as-much as it is not based on the direct examination of the witness.</mono>

  <question>Well I will read it to you, and then see if it is the one?</question>

  <questionnumber>162</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will read this ceremony here, and see if that is not the one that was performed at the time you were married?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it "is immeterial, impertinent, improper, and not cross examination".</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>163</questionnumber>
  <question>I will read from paragraph two, section one hundred and one of exhibit "E", as follows, - "Marriage should be celebrated with prayer and thanks - giving; and at the solemnization, the persons to be married, standing together, the man on the right, and the woman on the left, shall be addressed by the person officiating, as he shall be directed by the Holy Spirit; and if thee be no legal objections, he shall say, calling each by their names; "you both mutally agree to be each others companions, husband and wife, observing the legal right belonging to this condition; that is keeping yourselves wholly for each other, and from all others during your lives". And when they shall have answered "yes", he shall pronounce them "husband and wife" in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the laws of the country and authority vested in him; "may God add his blessings and keep you to fulfill your covenants from henceforth and forever. Amen". What do you say to that? Was that the ceremony used?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember what the ceremony was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>164</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that the ceremony, - that is the ceremony that is in this book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>The ceremony that was used was the ceremony that was used at the time that I was married. It was the ceremony that was lawful in Illinois at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>165</questionnumber>
  <question>And was it not the ceremony that was lawful in the church at the time you were married?</question>
  <answer>Well of course I suppose it was.</answer>

  <question>Well don't you know it was?</question>
  <answer>I don't know anything about it, for I don't know what ceremony he used. I don't know a thing about it for I did not take any note of it, either to write it down or make any minute of it either in my memory or in any memorandum book: and so I can't tell you anything about the ceremony that was used, for I don't know or remember anything at all about it, one way or the other.</answer>

  <question>This man Groves that married you, I believe you stated he was an elder in the church?</question>

  <question>Now I will read this marriage ceremony to you again, - "you both mutally agree to be each others companion, husband and wife, observing the legal right belonging to this condition; that is, kepping yourselves wholly for each other, and from all others, during your lives". Now was that repeated to you?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper cross examination, and for the further reason that the witness has repeatedly stated that he does not recollect the ceremony that was used on the occasion of his marriage, or any part of it.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>171</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question, - was that repeated to you?</question>
  <answer>I do not remember the ceremony that was used.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>172</questionnumber>

  <question>Groves had been a minister in Missouri, before that time, hadn't he?</question>
  <answer>He was a minister before that but I don't know for how long.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>181</questionnumber>
  <question>You had belonged to the church for a good while before that hadn't you?</question>

  <questionnumber>187</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you want to go on record here as saying that some time between '36 and 1841 you were married,-you do not know the year, but it was some where between these dates or years,-you were married by minister of your own church, and married a woman who was also a member of -your church, and then you say that you were married according to the laws of the state of Illinois, and not according to your church law? Is that what you wish to go on record as being your statement?</question>
  <answer>I say that I don't wish to decide on that point at all. That may-be correct and it may not be,-for I can't say what the ceremony was that was used, only I know it was according to the laws of the state of Illinois.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>188</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't say you do not know anything about that at all, do you?</question>
  <answer>I say I was married according to the laws of the state of Illinois, and that is all I do say". I have stated that repeatedly, but I can do it again if there is any satisfaction to you in attempting to bader me in the way you are trying to do. Now that is the way of it.-I presume I was married according of the ceremony prescribed by the laws of the state of Illinois,-at least I know I always supposed I was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>189</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you only suppose you were?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>190</questionnumber>
  <question>You were taught before that time that it was necessary to be married according to the laws of the church were you not?</question>
  <answer>I can't say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>191</questionnumber>
  <question>Well don't you know whether you were or not?</question>
  <answer>I can't say whether I was or not. I don't know that I was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>192</questionnumber>
  <question>Did not Joseph Smith and the Twelve Apostles all teach that?</question>
  <answer>They might have done it but I don't know. I am not so positive as to what they preached on that point.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>193</questionnumber>
  <question>Did not the-church have certain officers that could perform the marriage ceremony?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>194</questionnumber>
  <question>The church had certain officers that could perform the marriage ceremony, and certain other officers in the church, and yet could not perform the marriage ceremony?</question>
  <answer>According to the laws of the country, according to my understanding of that matter, all elders in the church could perform the marriage ceremony,-that had the right to perform marriage ceremonies.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>195</questionnumber>
  <question>They had right to solemnize the marriage ceremony?</question>
  <answer>I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>196</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it not the law of the church that elders and priests could perform the marriage ceremony, and no body else could?</question>
  <answer>I don't know sir.</answer>

  <question>You don't know about that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>198</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know that to be the fact, and don't you also know that the laws of Illinois did not say anything about it?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and improper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I did not post myself about the ceremony. I left that part of the matter in my case, entirely to Mr. Groves. I know one thing and that was I was satisfied that I was married all right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>199</questionnumber>
  <question>Was Groves a civil office in the state of Illinois.</question>
  <answer>Not that I am aware of, only that he was an officer in the church. He was an elder in the church, but I don't think he was an officer of the state of Illinois.</answer>

  <question>You don't?</question>

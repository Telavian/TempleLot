  <questionnumber>79</questionnumber>
  <question>Has the church here a record of the endowments?</question>
  <answer>I think he has a journal of his own that shows it but I don't know anything about the church records, for I understand they disappeared a good awhile ago, -that is a good many of the records did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>80</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you were sealed to your own husband?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>81</questionnumber>

  <answer>It seems to me now that it was in 1843, -but I am not positive as to that, but it seems to me now that that was the year, but I don't know whether it was in '2 or '2, -it was either one of these years though. Let me see, -it must have been in 1843.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>82</questionnumber>
  <question>You think it was in 1843 that you received the endowments?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>83</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it after the revelation of 1843 or before that?</question>
  <answer>I can't say, fot I hadn't heard about this before.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>84</questionnumber>
  <question>You had not heard about any revelation before?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I did not know anything about it, only for eternity.</answer>

  <question>You had heard of a revelation on the question of sealing for eternity before that time?</question>

  <questionnumber>95</questionnumber>
  <question>Well Mrs. Smith I am not on the witness stand now, and so I don't care about answering questions, but for your information I do not object to stating that it is not in there. Do you refer to the one on polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I think it is in there too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>96</questionnumber>
  <question>is that the one you heard of in 1842 or 1843?</question>
  <answer>I did not hear anything about this then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>97</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>99</questionnumber>
  <question>Sealing for eternity?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, sealing for eternity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>100</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is the one I am asking you about? The one on sealing for eternity, and not this one on polygamy? Now you said in your examination in chief that Joseph Smith in 1840 taught the principle of sealing?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, the principle of sealing did you say?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>101</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes ma'am?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that was the time I said he said the ancient order would be restored.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>102</questionnumber>
  <question>Speaking about sealing was he not?</question>
  <answer>Speaking about men having more wives than one I understood, - that was the general impression with reference to what he referred.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>103</questionnumber>
  <question>Well never mind what the general impression was, - the order of Abraham wasn't it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that was it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>104</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he mention any other name?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember for I did not pay much attention to it at the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>105</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if you did not pay very much attention to it at the time what made you think it was polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Well the way I considered polygamy was when a man had two wives, or more than one wife, he was in polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>106</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did Joseph Smith teach that a man could have two wives in 1840?</question>
  <answer>Well he was speaking about the ancient order that was to be restored.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did Abraham have more than one wife?</question>

  <questionnumber>108</questionnumber>
  <question>Well according to the record did he have more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>According to the bible he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>109</questionnumber>

  <answer>Yes sir. She said that and a good deal more, for she talked a good deal on the subject, but it has been so very many years ago, - about fifty years it has been since that, or nearly fifty years, - that I can't remember just what she did say altogether on that question, but she said more than I have stated.

  <answer>Well simply I suppose because I was acquainted with the other things that</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>421</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't remember then the statement I have referred to?</question>

    </pagenumber>and I might not have read it although it was published there.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>422</questionnumber>
  <question>Now there was a great stir in Nauvoo about the secret wife system was there not?</question>
  <answer>I did not read a word about it, and I did not believe in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>423</questionnumber>
  <question>Did not read a word about what and do not believe in what?</question>
  <answer>In that secret wife business, - I did not believe in it and read nothing about it at all, for I did not want to know anything about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>424</questionnumber>
  <question>There was less commotion, - I mean there was a great deal of commotion about it was there not?</question>
  <answer>I believe so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>425</questionnumber>
  <question>And in order to show that the church did not have anything to do with it, or the people generally, did not the officers of the church, or some one have a manifesto to the public, or an affidavit prepared, which was signed by the officers of the church, and the members of the ladies relief society, a great many of them including its officers, to the effect that there was no such a doctrine taught, or believed in or practiced by the church, either at that time or at any other time?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember it. 426 (Written as 423)</answer>
  <question>And was not that punished in the official church organ at that time, the Times and Seasons?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>427</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the church paper at that time, - the Times and Seasons?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but I did not take it at that time, and I don't think that I read that that you have described.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>428</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you say you did not read it?</question>
  <answer>I might have read it, but I don't remember one word of it if I did, and I don't think I did read it either.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>429</questionnumber>
  <question>Well let me read this to refresh your recollection I will read from page 930 of the Times and Seasons, - published October 1st 1842 as follows, - "We, the undersigned members of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and residents of the city of Nauvoo, persons of families, do hereby certify and declare that we know of no other rule or system of marriage than the one published from the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and we give this certificate to show that Dr. J.C. Bennett's secret wife system is a creature of his own make, as we know of no such a society in this place, nor never did." Now have you ever heard of that before?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that the book that the counsel for the plaintiff read the foregoing extract from, - or the passage that he has read is objected to for the reason that the book from thich it was taken has not been properly identified as the Times and Seasons from which the notice purports to have been taken, or published in.</mono>
  <answer>I don't know anything about that. I can't say that I know anything about that, and I believe his words were false anyway, for he was a wicked man, and I was pretty sure of that from what I knew of him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>430</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was a wicked man?</question>
  <answer>That is Mr. Bennett was a wicked man, and I believe his words were false, and it did not require that to make me think so either.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>431</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know that there was a great stir there in Nauvoo at that time about John C. Bennett's secret wife system?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I did at the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>432</questionnumber>
  <question>And the church published him and expelled him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>433</questionnumber>
  <question>And they preached against him from the stand?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>434</questionnumber>
  <question>And against plural marriage?</question>
  <answer>No sir, there was not plural marriage about it.</answer>

  <questionnumber>435</questionnumber>
  <question>Well the secret wife system?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>436</questionnumber>
  <question>And secret marriage?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. What is it they called - it, - was it not "spiritual wifery" or something like that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>437</questionnumber>
  <question>Well they preached against the spiritual wife system did they not, - that is the officers and leaders of the church did?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>438</questionnumber>
  <question>And the spiritual wife system was the system by which a man had two wives at the same time?</question>
  <answer>Yes, - no, no that was not the way I understood it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>439</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was the spiritual wife system?</question>
  <answer>The spiritual wife system was if a man had a wife living and a wife dead, if she was sealed to him that was his spiritual wife, - the dead one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>440</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that the doctrine of John C. Bennett?</question>
  <answer>That was the way John C. Bennett talked it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>441</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then John C. Bennett's theory or doctrine did not allow a man to have more than one wife living at the same time?</question>
  <answer>I don't know about that. I don't think that he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>442</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he not preach it, and have more than one wife at the same time?</question>
  <answer>Well no, but he had better had.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>443</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he not have several women there in Nauvoo at the same time, and was not that the cause of the trouble there in which he figured?</question>
  <answer>Well some of my young friends I know, - -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>444</questionnumber>
  <question>And did they not turn his house over into the ditch because he had so many wives?</question>
  <answer>Well he did not have many wives, - I did not understand that he had many wives, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>445</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he not have several women there that he had as wives?</question>
  <answer>I don't know whether they were his wives or not. I don't know anything about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>446</questionnumber>
  <question>Well didn't he have several wives or women there that he cohabited with?</question>
  <answer>Well there was several young girls went there I know, one of whom I was well acquainted with.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>447</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was the spiritual wife doctrine, and he called them mistresses?</question>
  <answer>No John C. Bennett did not pretend that he was present at anything like that. He did not pretend to say anything like that as I understood it. He was denouncing that in other people as I understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>448</questionnumber>
  <question>Then this certificate that says that "John C. Bennett's secret wife system is a creature of his own make" is false? Is that what you say now?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>449</questionnumber>
  <question>Then he did have secret wives?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>450</questionnumber>
  <question>He did not, and yet you say that certificate which says that his secret wife system is a creature of his own make is so?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for John C. Bennett never had any wife that I knew anything of, - he never had one wife that I knew anything of in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>451</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I would like for you to state what was his secret wife doctrine that they saw fit to denounce?</question>
  <answer>Well he was trying to put it on some one else, - that some one else had secret wives I suppose.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>452</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he charging members of the church with it?</question>
  <answer>That must have been it I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>453</questionnumber>
  <question>And then the church said there was no such thing in the church? The officers of the church signed that certificate certifying to the fact that there was no such a thing in the church?</question>

  </pagenumber>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>454</questionnumber>
  <question>No such a doctrine in the church?</question>
  <answer>No sir, no such a doctrine as he had.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>455</questionnumber>
  <question>No such a doctrine as he had?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and I don't believe there was either.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>456</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will read you this from the Ladies Relief Society of which you were a member?</question>
  <answer>All right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>457</questionnumber>
  <question>It is from the same book and page as that which I last read to you, - namely on page 940, - "We, the undersigned members of the Ladies Relief Society, and married females, do certify and declare that we know of no system of marriage being practiced in the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, save the one contained in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and we give this certificate to the public to show that J.C. Bennett's "secret wife system" is a disclosure of his own make." Now that is the certificate, and it is signed by Emma Smith, President; , - Elizabeth Ann Whitney, Counselor; , - Sarah M. Cleveland, Counselor; , Eliza R. Snow, Secretary; , and the following members, - Mary C. Miller, - Lois Cutler, - Thirza Cahoon, - Ann Hunter, - Jane Law, - Sophia R. Marks, - Polly Z. Johnson, - Abigail Works, - Catherine Pettey, - Sarah Higbee, - Phebe Woodruff, - Lenora Taylor, - Sarah Hillman, - Rosanna Marks, - and Angeline Robinson. Now what do you say to that?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not cross examination, and on the further ground that the plaintiff has not shown that the extract read from the book referred to (and which is objected to for the same reasons as were stated in the objection here-to-fore made when the certificate signed by the officers of the church was offerred in evidence) is a book that was published by the authority of the church, or that the part of said book just read to witness was published by authority of the church.</mono>
  <answer>Well sir, I believe that that shows that they simply denounced him and his doctrine, and I believe that is all that is to be understood by it, and all they meant.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>458</questionnumber>
  <question>Then this certificate signed by the Ladies Relief Society of which you were a member, was true then was it not? According to the best of your recollection and belief you may state whether or not it was true?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and my best recollection is that that John C. Bennett's doctrine was all false.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>459</questionnumber>
  <question>And as such was denounced by the members of your society?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, perhaps that was so, but as I told you before I did not remember this well enough to say positively how it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>460</questionnumber>
  <question>You heard the named that I have read here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>461</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recognize them as being members of the Ladies Relief Society?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, some f them I do, but I have no doubt but that they all did. I see that the members of our society denounced it, but I was not there at the time that that action was taken so I cannot say what was done, but I presume their action is correctly reported there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>462</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it true at that time that there was no other rue with reference to marriage practiced other than that set forth in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>No to my knowledge there was not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>463</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the only method of marriage?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>464</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that disclosed in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that was it, and I was married by that myself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>465</questionnumber>

    </pagenumber>heard Joseph Smith at one time say to the sisters, that all was well, and you understood what he meant by that?
  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I heard him say that the ancient order of marriage would be revived, and we all understood that he meant by that polygamy or plural wives. That is what we all understood he meant by that, and I think that was the only meaning that could be extracted from it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>466</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now as a matter of fact did he say anything about polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Well he did not use the word "polygamy" but he said "some of your sisters are in trouble" and he went on to say "now don't be alarmed all will be well in the end" or "all will be right in the end" or something like that.</answer>

    </pagenumber>ted before the death of Joseph Smith?
  </question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>487</questionnumber>
  <question>Now state to the reporter if you can, some of the parties that you talked with about that question?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground tnd for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination and hearsay.</mono>
  <answer>I think the main one was Sister Emma Smith. Of course we talked to each other about it a little bit but I did not pay much attention to it, for I was not concerned about it myself,- I hadn't any trouble myself, but of course we talked to each other a little about it, but not much. It was a kind of a private thing that we did not care to talk much about, for we did like Paul directed, we went to our husbands if we wanted to know anything or wanted advice and direction,- when we wanted to know anything we went to our husbands instead of going to our neighbors when we wanted to know anything about principles we did not understand and if they did not know what to advise us they secured the information and gave it to us.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>488</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you stated in your cross examination that you did not know any one that was publicly known as the wives of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>489</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will ask you if you knew any one who was considered as his wife, but not publicly?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, leading and hearsay.</mono>
  <answer>I can't tell you that I did. I can't say that I did at that time, but I got acquainted with them afterwards, and they told me that they were his wives. Different ones did, but I don't remember one in his life time that I knew was his wife, or who told me that they were his wives.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>490</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you were asked the question if there was any doctrine taught in the church to the effect that a man could be sealed to some one else's wife</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>491</questionnumber>
  <question>Now will you tell the reporter if you remember that there was any thing said in regard to a man being sealed to a woman, that was not somebody else's wife?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and is leading and does not call for the best evidence.</mono>
  <answer>I believe there were a good many women that were sealed to Joseph Smith in his life-time, but I never was present at the sealing of any one of them to him.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness, and moves the court to exclude it from the record as incompetent, and an opinion of the witness, and not a statment of fact.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>492</questionnumber>
  <question>You cannot say whether there was or was not any such a principle tuaght?</question>
  <answer>When?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>493</questionnumber>
  <question>In the life-time of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I believe it was taught, for I know that Sister Emma referred to that. I know that I heard of it before she referred to it, but I had not been worried about it myself, but I heard there was such a thing taught before she spoke of it, or mentioned it to me, but there was not one of them that ever come to to me and told me that she was Joseph'S wife until after that, until after he was dead I think.</answer>

  <questionnumber>494</questionnumber>
  <question>They told you that after Joseph's death?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>495</questionnumber>
  <question>They told you that they were, or had been Joseph's wives?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness to the question asked, as well as the question on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, leading and is hearsay, and moves the court to strike the answer from the record for the reasons above given.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>496</questionnumber>
  <question>Now will you state to the reporter if those parties who referred to the principle of plural marriage before the time that Emma Smith spoke to you about it, - state whether they were members of the church or not?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds above set forth.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>496</questionnumber>
  <question>Who were they?</question>
  <answer>They had spoken to me about it before the time that Emma spoke to me about it, and they were sisters in the church, but remember that at that time I had not heard any one say that they were wives of Joseph, but we heard that they sealed to Joseph before his death, and before we had our endowments. Now the time that Emma talked to us was that day I was taking my endowments.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>497</questionnumber>
  <question>You may state to the reporter whether or not you heard any mention of a revelation that had been given on that subject by Joseph Smith, in any of these conversations?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, is hearsay and leading, and not proper re-direct examination.</mono>
  <answer>I expect I have heard of it, but if I have I don't remember it. I can't remember the day and date and all about it, but of course I believe there had been a revelation upon that subject. When Sister Emma talked with us upon the subject, I believe that at that time there had been a revelation on the subject.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness, and moves the court to strike it from the record on the ground that it is incompetent and hearsay and immaterial.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>498</questionnumber>
  <question>Did Sister Emma say anything to you about a revelation?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember what she said, but I remember that distinctly, - I distinctly remember about her saying that our husbands were intending to take other wives if we didn't hinder it.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question and the answer of the witness for the reasons above set forth.</mono>

  <question>Did she say anything about sealing or a revelation on that subject at that time?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember, but I presume she did. She said a good deal more than I can state here for I don't remember it, and it is probable that she said something on that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>501</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you remember that she did?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember that she did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>502</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember that she did not?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember anything about what she said only what I have told you, but I do remember that she talked with us quite a little bit, - she talked quite a while to us, but what she said I cannot remember.</answer>

  <question>Then you want to go on record here as swearing that you heard it talked of at Nauvoo, that a man could be sealed to two different women?</question>
  <answer>Well I meant to say that two different women could be sealed to one man, but a man could not be sealed to two women, but two different women could be sealed to one man, - a man could have two different women sealed to him, but he cannot be sealed to them.</answer>

  <question>But you don't mean to say that Joseph Smith had that man's wife living with him as his wife?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I mean that she was sealed to him for eternity and I think that it was a good thing for her, for she will be much better of in eternity, - much better off in the next world than if she had stuck to Law.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>578</questionnumber>

    </pagenumber>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper re-cross examination, and does not call for the best evidence of the fact, but calls for an opinion of the witness.

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>581</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the doctrine of the church here in Salt Lake at the present time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>582</questionnumber>
  <question>And it is the doctrine of the church as taught here not in the church in Utah Territory under the administration of President Woodruff? The doctrine is that a woman cannot be exalted in the hereafter unless they are sealed. Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that the books which contain the doctrine of the church are themselves the best evidence of what the church teaches, and of its doctrine.</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we believe that they cannot be exalted in the Celestial kingdom, - that is the man will be alone and the woman will be alone.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>583</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what the church teaches here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>587</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he teach it personally?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>588</questionnumber>
  <question>When did he teach it to you?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't remember just the day and date when he taught it to me, but he taught it or I would not have been sealed to my husband.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>589</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when did he do that?</question>
  <answer>After he gave us our endowments, and he taught us to have our prayers answered and so on.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>590</questionnumber>
  <question>Did Joseph Smith teach you that a man must have more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>To be exalted?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>591</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes madam?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never heard of that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>592</questionnumber>
  <question>But you were taught that a man must be sealed to his wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that his own wife must be sealed to him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>593</questionnumber>
  <question>But you were never taught by Joseph Smith, that a man must have two wives sealed to him?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>594</questionnumber>
  <question>He did not teach that, not did any one else teach that in Nauvoo prior to Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I believe they did, but I don't know it for certain. I only think they did, for I don't know anything positively about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>595</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now they teach here in Salt Lake City, - President Woodruff and President Young and President John Taylor, taught you and all the rest of the ladies, here in Salt Lake City that attended church that a man must be sealed?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>596</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was it?</question>
  <answer>That a woman must be sealed to a man, but not a man sealed to a woman.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>597</questionnumber>
  <question>That a man in order to be exalted in the kingdom celestial must have more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they taught that a man could have more than one wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>598</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what they taught?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>599</questionnumber>

  <answer>Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>601</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you hear that?</question>
  <answer>Did I hear him say that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>602</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes madam?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>603</questionnumber>
  <question>You are not willing to sear to that as a fact?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but I have heard that a good many times.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>604</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say that is an expression of Joseph Smith's?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I so understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>605</questionnumber>
  <question>Now don't you know that it is in a sermon of Brigham Young's preached after Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>Well I think Joseph said that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>606</questionnumber>
  <question>But you are not willing to swear that he did say that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I am not willing to swear that he said it, but I think that he said it for I think I have heard it state that he said it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>607</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is the reason you believe it?</question>
  <answer>Well I believe everything he taught, and if he taught any thing I was just as certain it was right as I could be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>608</questionnumber>
  <question>But you did not hear him say that a man that had a wife had a jewel, and the man that had more than one wife had many jewels?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but I believe he said it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>609</questionnumber>
  <question>You believe he said it because some one told you he did?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>610</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you believe everything that people tell you?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>611</questionnumber>
  <question>But you believe that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I believe that everything he said was just as right as it could be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>612</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't believe he could make a mistake or err in anything?</question>
  <answer>Well hardly anything.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>613</questionnumber>
  <question>You thought he was about right?</question>
  <answer>I thought he was just about as perfect as a man could be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>614</questionnumber>
  <question>You thought he was infallibel?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I thought he was mortal just as we are, but I thought he was as nearly a perfect man as could be. I think he was inspired, and I think there was hardly any of the time that he was un-inspired.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>615</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not think it was hardly possible for him to sin?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't put it that way. 616 (Question and answer are missing)</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>617</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what way do you put it?</question>
  <answer>I think he might sin, - but it was hardly possible that he would sin, - he could commit sin if he wanted to so so, but I don't think it was at all likely that he would do so. Of course I can't say as to that, for he might have sinned.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>618</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you think that he was inspired at the time that he told you that he was not inspired?</question>
  <answer>Was not.</answer>

  <question>Don't you remember his declaration to the effect that he was not inspired?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>620</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you remember that he at one time declared that he was not inspired?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>621</questionnumber>
  <question>And that he did not want the people of Nauvoo to follow him?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't recollect that either, but I do not say that he was all the time inspired, but I think as a general thing he was. I know that I had the greatest faith in him and in everything that he taught, and if he taught anything I believed it was the truth or he would not teach it. That is what I believe, for I believe that everything he taught was right and righteous if it had been carried out right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>622</questionnumber>

    </pagenumber>Covenants, is that not it?
  </question>
  <answer>What is the question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>623</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if it is not a fact that when he preached from tha platform anywhere or from the pulpit or stand, -when he preached publicly and laid down the doctrines of the church, he taught the doctrine of the church as it is laid down in the bible, the book of Mormon, and the book of Doctrine and Covenants, did he not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>624</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was the doctrine of the church, as you understood it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>625</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was the only doctrine there was to the church was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but when he gave us our endowments I thought that was another notch ahead, and when he authorized sealings for time and eternity that was another.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>626</questionnumber>
  <question>These were simply, according to your understanding, notches in the progressive action of the doctrine of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>627</questionnumber>
  <question>Had the church as a body directed that the endowments be given?</question>

  <question>When?</question>
  <answer>Before Joseph died.</answer>

  <question>I do not believe you understand the question, -I asked you if the church had directed or authorized that the endowments should be given?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>630</questionnumber>
  <question>When did they authorize it?</question>
  <answer>Before Joseph died.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>631</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did they take that action?</question>
  <answer>It was done by authority of President Joseph Smith and the Twelve apostles and Hyrum.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>632</questionnumber>
  <question>When did they do it?</question>
  <answer>I believe it was in 1843.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>633</questionnumber>
  <question>At a meeting?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. It was at a meeting.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>634</questionnumber>

  <question>Who was it submitted to?</question>
  <answer>To the Twelve and a few others.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>636</questionnumber>
  <question>To the Twelve and a few others you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>637</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what it was submitted to?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think that was it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>638</questionnumber>
  <question>Do not the rules of the church require that the doctrine of the church shall be submitted to the church as a body and be accepted by the church in that capacity before it can become a law binding upon the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I believe it does.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>639</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was that submitted to the church, or only to the Twelve?</question>
  <answer>Well to the church, -I think that was the intention, and I have heard him say that he had no right, -if he had a revelation he had no right to teach it or preach it until he had submitted it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>640</questionnumber>
  <question>Until he had submitted it to the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>To the whole church?</question>
  <answer>Well not to the whole church but to the members of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>642</questionnumber>
  <question>To what part of the church was it to be submitted?</question>
  <answer>To the Twelve apostles.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>643</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were not all the revelations that were submitted to the church, that were received through Joseph Smith, submitted to the whole church, and voted on by the general church?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>644</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you swear positively they were not?</question>
  <answer>Well not by all the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>645</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were they not submitted to all the church that came to a general conference?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. All that chose to come to the conference voted on it, and so it was with the revelation an celestial marriage, for I was told that it was voted on in that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>646</questionnumber>
  <question>But you were not present?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>647</questionnumber>

  <question>And you believed it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>654</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if that was submitted there and adopted by the church, what was the necessity of resubmitting it here in Salt Lake City in 1852?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>655</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know anything about that?</question>

  <questionnumber>656</questionnumber>
  <question>Was not publicly done where?</question>
  <answer>In Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>657</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know it was not submitted there at all?</question>
  <answer>Well I was not there of course when it was done, but I believe it was, for I have heard men testify that they were present at the high council when that was submitted and accepted. They believed it and I believed it too and I believe it yet.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>658</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you believe everything you hear?</question>
  <answer>No sir, there is lots of things I hear that I don't believe, but you can't help believing these things sometimes when it comes to you in that way, and that is one of the things that I hear that I can't help but believe it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>659</questionnumber>
  <question>Well suppose half the high council said it was not submitted, then what would you say about it?</question>
  <answer>I would say they did not speak the truth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>660</questionnumber>
  <question>Well suppose they believed they were speaking the truth, then what would you say?</question>
  <answer>I would say they did not tell the truth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>661</questionnumber>
  <question>You would say that irrespective of whether they were speaking the truth, or were not speaking the truth?</question>
  <answer>Well if they said that they would not be speaking the truth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>662</questionnumber>
  <question>Why would you say that?</question>
  <answer>Well there was not half of them that did not approve of it, there was only one or two that made any objects to it, if I have been told correctly what occurred there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>663</questionnumber>
  <question>Which ones were they that objected to it?</question>

  <question>Name one of them?</question>
  <answer>I cannot tell you.</answer>

  <answer>I don't remember who the high counselors were at that time, I can't remember their names at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>669</questionnumber>

  <answer>I don't remember whether they were or not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>670</questionnumber>

  <question>And you believe that statement in the face of the statement that there were two or three voted against it?</question>
  <answer>I believe it was all right anyway, but I can't tell you whether I heard that or not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>674</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not just say that you heard that it was adopted by the High Council with the exception of two or three that voted against it?</question>
  <answer>I said I heard that they was only two or three that did not agree with it, but I don't know who told me that or where I heard it. I can't say whether I heard it from them or not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>675</questionnumber>

  <answer>Yes sir, - one or two at any rate.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>676</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not say that there was one who claimed that it was never submitted to the High Council at all, - one of the High Council who made that claim?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know that I said that, but I have heard that much.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>677</questionnumber>
  <question>You have heard that, - that there was one member of the High Council who made the claim or statement that it was never submitted to the High Council at all?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I have heard that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>678</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know that the rules of the church require that it must be passed by an unanimous vote of the High Council before it can become a church law?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't know that it must be unanimous, - I think it has to have the consent of the majority of the members of the High Council.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>679</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>693</questionnumber>
  <question>Then how do you know it was submitted?</question>
  <answer>Well I was told that it was and I believe it was. I believed them when they said it had been submitted.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>694</questionnumber>
  <question>I refer to the submission of their revelation on polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I understand what you mean.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>695</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what you mean was submitted to the High Council?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>696</questionnumber>
  <question>Is your testimony in this case based on hearsay in that way?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but what I know of my own knowledge I say I know of my own knowledge, and what some one else told me I say they told me. What I know I say I know, and what I have heard from some one else I give you as having heard it from some one else, but still I believe a great many things that great and good men tell me, - just as fully and freely as if I saw it with my own eyes. Now I have told you that I have never heard Joseph Smith say much about it himself, and yet I believe that he did what is said to have been done by him in that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>697</questionnumber>
  <question>Well Joseph was dead before this revelation was submitted to the High Council?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>698</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when was it submitted to the High Council?</question>
  <answer>When he was alive.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>699</questionnumber>
  <question>The revelation on polygamy was submitted to the High Council before his death, - Is that what you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>700</questionnumber>
  <question>Who told you any thing about it while Joseph Smith was alive?</question>
  <answer>I guess my husband did. I don't recollect, but I guess it was my husband.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>701</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did anyone else say anything about it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I have heard it talked of by different ones while he was alive.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>702</questionnumber>
  <question>Did your husband tell you anything about polygamy while Joseph Smith was alive?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>703</questionnumber>
  <question>He did?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I believe he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>704</questionnumber>
  <question>You believe he did?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>705</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did he?</question>
  <answer>I believe he did I say, - I know he told me about time and eternity and all that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>706</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not say a while ago that there wasn't anybody said anything to you about polygamy until after Joseph Smiths' death?</question>
  <answer>Well I am not sure that they did in the way of calling polygamy, for it was sealing for time and eternity then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>707</questionnumber>
  <question>There is a difference between the revelation on sealing and the revelation on polygamy, is there not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>708</questionnumber>
  <question>They are two different papers, or revelations, entirely, are they not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I think the same revelation tells it all, - contains it all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>709</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say the same revelation tells it all?</question>
  <answer>Well don't it?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>710</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am asking you the question if the revelation on sealing contains the revelation on polygamy?</question>
  <answer>It is for time and eternity, - that is the revelation on sealing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>711</questionnumber>
  <question>The revelation on sealing a man's wife to him is you say a different thing entirely from the revelation on polygamy?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't say any such a thing. If you read the two, - if you read it altogether you will see that it is all there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>712</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I have read it right together?</question>
  <answer>Well don't it teach polygamy?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>713</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am asking you now what you know about it?</question>
  <answer>
    Well sometimes I have got it and read it to the sisters, and that is what I

    </pagenumber>understood by it. I tried to make the sisters at first believe that it meant but one wife, but it is as much as a bargain for you to extract that meaning out of it, - it is a hard thing to make it mean that.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>714</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now let us understand each other, for this is what I am getting at Mrs. Smith, - when the question, - in 1842 or '3 there, there was a revelation on sealing, - on sealing a man's wife to himself was there not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>715</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was the practice was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>716</questionnumber>
  <question>You were not sealed to somebody' else's man were you?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>717</questionnumber>
  <question>You were sealed to your own husband?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>718</questionnumber>
  <question>You were taught that you were to be sealed to your husband?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>719</questionnumber>
  <question>You were not taught that you could be sealed to Brigham Young or some one other than your own husband?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I was not taught that, for I would not have swapped him off for any man I ever saw.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>720</questionnumber>
  <question>And the revelation on polygamy teaches that you could be sealed to other men?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>721</questionnumber>
  <question>That is that you could, for instance, be sealed to Heber C. Kimball or George Q. Cannon or to the other Cannon or to any one else?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>722</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what do you call that?</question>
  <answer>I suppose that is polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>723</questionnumber>
  <question>Well not don't you know thare was two distinct and separate revelations on these two different subjects?</question>
  <answer>I believe this that Joseph Smith had more than one or two wives. I do believe that sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>724</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is not an answer to my question, - my question is if there were not two entirely different and distinct revelations?</question>
  <answer>I don't think they were, - I think they were all in the one, - I have tried to make myself believe that that revelation did not mean polygamy, but I can't do it, and I can't see how any other meaning can be got out of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>725</questionnumber>
  <question>Now did you over read this revelation on polygamy when you were living in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>726</questionnumber>
  <question>You never read it there?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>727</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see it when you were there?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <question>You never saw it there in print?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>729</questionnumber>
  <question>Nor in any other form?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>730</questionnumber>
  <question>You never saw it in print or writing there?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never saw it in any shape until after I came here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>731</questionnumber>
  <question>You husband was a counselor to Brigham Young?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, he was here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>732</questionnumber>
  <question>Now don't you know that this revelation on polygamy was submitted to the church here in 1852, - I mean to the church here in Utah Territory, - was submitted to the church at a conference held in the tabernacle in this city in 1852?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was publicly submitted.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>733</questionnumber>
  <question>With the declaration of Brigham Young himself, that nobody knew it was in existence but himself?</question>
  <answer>Oh, no, I don't think that statement was made.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>734</questionnumber>
  <question>That he kept it under lock and key and nobody knew of its existence but himself, - nobody knew that it was in existence but himself?</question>
  <answer>Well that might be so and it might not be so.</answer>

  <questionnumber>735</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did not President Brigham Young say that publicly on the stand in the Tabernacle, and is it not given publicity in the Journal of Discourses, as having been preached by Brigham Young?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>736</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you say it is not?</question>
  <answer>I suppose it is. If you say it is in there I do not dispute your word, for I don't know that it is not in there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>737</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say you have never seen it and read it in the Journal of Discourses?</question>
  <answer>I say I have no recollection of it if I have.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>738</questionnumber>
  <question>if it is in the Journal of Discourses it is correctly reported is it not?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say. I presume it is though. I have heard it discusses about Sister Emma burning, that is burning the original, but they had a copy of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>739</questionnumber>
  <question>Did not Brigham Young say on the occasion of the presentation of that alleged revelation to the church here in the tabernacle in Salt Lake City in 1852, Emma, Joseph Smith's wife had burned the original, but that he had had a copy of it and kept it under lock and key, and nobody knew it was in existence but himself?</question>
  <answer>Well no, I don't recollect of his saying that, but still I believe they did have a copy of it for it was read around there in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>740</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that before Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>I think so, and afterwards too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>741</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you read it alos?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but I heard it was in existence.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>742</questionnumber>
  <question>Now as a matter of fact what is the truth as to these parties telling you about it that copy that was alleged to be in existence before or after the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say positively as to that, but I rather think it was since.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>743</questionnumber>
  <question>And is it not a fact that they told you about it since you came here to Salt Lake?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was before I came here. It was while we were in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>744</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it not after Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>I don't know sir, that I hear it before his death, - I rather think it has been since he died.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>745</questionnumber>
  <question>After you heard there was such a revelation, did you not enquire after it?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>746</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not concern yourself about it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for I thought they had it all right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>747</questionnumber>
  <question>What had it all right did you think?</question>
  <answer>The proper officers of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>748</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you not try to find it?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>749</questionnumber>
  <question>Why not?</question>
  <answer>Because it was no concern of mine at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>750</questionnumber>
  <question>Your husband was one of the chief officers of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. And he knew where it was I expect.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>751</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever ask him anything about it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir we have talked about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>752</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he say there was such a thing in existence?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. 753 (This question is missing)</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>754</questionnumber>
  <question>When?</question>
  <answer>Well he said it was in existence when we were in Nauvoo, but as I have already stated, I did not see it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>755</questionnumber>
  <question>He said there was a revelation on that subject?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>756</questionnumber>
  <question>Your husband told you that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>757</questionnumber>

  <answer>At Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>758</questionnumber>

  </pagenumber>
  <answer>Certainly he knew of it before Joseph's death.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>760</questionnumber>
  <question>Then he told you of the existence of this revelation before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is what I said. Well now I would like to qualify that answer for it is possible that he did not tell me of it before Joseph died, it is possible that he did not tell me of it until afterwards, it seems to me now that he did not, but I am not sure of that either. I can't say as to that positively.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>761</questionnumber>
  <question>Well after you came here to Salt Lake city, your husband was counselor to Brigham Young?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>762</questionnumber>
  <question>And you had a good place in the tabernacle here to sit, where you could hear everything that was said and see everything that was going on in the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I had to be pretty well posted in Mormonism to be able to get along in the position I was in of course.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>763</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were you present when this revelation was presented for adoption by the church?</question>
  <answer>I think I was there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>764</questionnumber>
  <question>You heard what was said?</question>
  <answer>I think I was there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>765</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you heard what was said?</question>
  <answer>I presume I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>766</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you know whether or not you heard what was said?</question>
  <answer>I presume I did. I was there I think and I presume I heard what was said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>767</questionnumber>
  <question>There was three or four or five men preached sermons there that time before it was finally presented to the church for adoption?</question>
  <answer>I believe so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>768</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know that Orson Pratt preached in the forenoon of that day, and referred to the fact that in the afternoon a revelation would be presented to the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think so. I believe I remember that, and I believe I was there when it was presented.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>769</questionnumber>
  <question>And there was a vote taken on it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>770</questionnumber>
  <question>And you raise your hand on it when it was voted on?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think I did. I think I was there, - there isn't much doubt about that, and I know one thing that I was just as positive that that revelation was true, and I was just as sure of it as of any thing that could possibly happen, - there wasn't a particle of doubt in my mind at the time as to the truth of the revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>771</questionnumber>
  <question>Well we don't care about that?</question>
  <answer>Well I care about it, for it was and is a matter of conscience with me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>772</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is immaterial, for it is not a question of the truth or falsity of the revelation that men cannot take two or more wives now, - it is because of the veto that "Uncle Sam" through the minions of his law has put upon it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and that is a disgrace to this great county the way that they have acted, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>773</questionnumber>
  <question>What is a disgrace, - the way the church out here has acted or the way the officers of the civil law of the country has acted?</question>
  <answer>Well it don't matter, it is all right I suppose.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>774</questionnumber>
  <question>Has the practice of a man having as many wives as he wanted out here ceased because the church has abandoned the practice?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>775</questionnumber>
  <question>Or is it because the church here has voted to abolish it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>776</questionnumber>
  <question>The church has voted to abolish it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>777</questionnumber>
  <question>Could anybody go into the practice of polygamy before the church decided to abolish it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I suppose so.</answer>

  <questionnumber>778</questionnumber>
  <question>Could they go into the practice of polygamy before the church directed it or authorized it?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>779</questionnumber>
  <question>They would not do it until it was directed by the church, then?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>780</questionnumber>
  <question>If they did do such a thing they were violators of the law were they not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>781</questionnumber>
  <question>If they did that, they were not only violators of the law of the church, but of the state in which they lived at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That is so. Now sir, I will tell you another thing, - you may say everything you please against that principle, and you may deny as much as you please that he ever preached it, but I believe that Joseph Smith did preach it, and not only preached it but secretly practiced it. Yes sir, I believe that he both preached it and that he practiced it too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>782</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will ask you what your business has been in the territory since you have been here?</question>
  <answer>In what way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>783</questionnumber>
  <question>Well say in connection with the church, - what your business has been in connection with the church? What position have you held?</question>
  <answer>Well I have been in so many things it is hard to say. I have been working at the endowment house for sixteen or seventeen years, and I have been associated with the relief society of which I am president now for some times, and I ought to be at their meeting right now, and would be if you were not detaining me, and I have been Counselor for this stake, - that is Sister Home, - that is in the relief society, and I have been in various other things, - I might say too numerous to mention and not be very far out of the way. I have had a good many important offices since I have been here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>784</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you ought to be able to know something about what I am going to ask you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I probably might, and I might not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>785</questionnumber>
  <question>You said you were president to some one, - I mean counselor to some one, - who was that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I am counselor to some one, - who was that?</answer>
  <answer>Yes sir, I am Counselor to Sister Zina Young, who is President of all the relief societies over the world some three hundred or four hundred in number.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>786</questionnumber>
  <question>Holding these multifarious offices, if there is any thing in connection with the work of the church you ought to be the one to know it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I will probably know as much about it as anybody. I remember that when I had my patriarchial blessing from the prophet's father in Missouri, I remember that when he blessed me he said that I would not in my understanding come a whit behind anybody. I do now want that to go down, for that is something that I said in friendly badinage with this gentleman here. (Mr. P.P. Kelley.)</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>787</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you have been in the endowment house you say for about sixteen years, and during that time you have trained yourself and other ladies?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we have been trained in everything that is good, and nothing that is bad.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>788</questionnumber>
  <question>And you understand all about the endowments, - about endowment matters?</question>
  <answer>Well I understand a good deal about it. Not all, - but a good deal.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>789</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now I will ask you if you don't know, in taking the endowments, how the ladies are dressed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>790</questionnumber>
  <question>And whether or not they are not dressed differently from what they were when you took your endowments in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they are dressed differently but that don't make any difference in the ceremonies or in the blessings, for they are the same.</answer>

  <questionnumber>791</questionnumber>
  <question>Well they are dressed differently you say?</question>
  <answer>No sir, you are mistaken. I know what you are talking about, but you are mistaken for they are dressed exactly the same, because they keep the same doctrine.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>792</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how could they dress differently if they were the same?</question>
  <answer>What is that, - that is something I don't understand?</answer>

  <questionnumber>820</questionnumber>
  <question>Well just because I want to know?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons that it is incompetent and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, and on the further ground that it is an attempt to get at something in an indirect way that the court would not permit the counsel to get in a direct manner, as the witness is being questioned regarding something which she is under an obligation not to reveal.</mono>

  <answer>Well you know people are apt to commit a great many little follies and sins when they are on a long journey like we took, and go through the perils and privation that we went through, and while I do not think that I committed any sins in particular, still I felt like all the rest did about, that there would be no particular harm in our being re-baptized for the remission of any sin or error that we had fallen into, - we just felt that we had better be re-baptized and that it would not hurt us if we were. 847 (Written as 837)</answer>
  <question>And that was the reason of your baptism when you arrived here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>853</questionnumber>
  <question>Then why were you baptized the second time if you had not broken your covenants, and got out of Christ?</question>

  <questionnumber>854</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you were baptized into another covenant?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was the same covenant.</answer>

  <question>Well it was given after you had been baptized the first time?</question>
  <answer>Certainly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>860</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it must have been a different one, was it not?</question>

  <questionnumber>861</questionnumber>
  <question>You think the first covenant comprises it all?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>862</questionnumber>
  <question>There was no revelation on polygamy when you were baptized the first time in 1837?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>863</questionnumber>
  <question>So you did not have the new covenants to be baptized into at that time did you?</question>
  <answer>I think it comprehends it all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>864</questionnumber>
  <question>You think your first baptism comprehends it all?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>865</questionnumber>
  <question>Then why were you baptized here the second time, and the third time and the fourth time out here?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir. No sir, I was mistaken in that, it was not under his Presidency.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>871</questionnumber>
  <question>Well whose Presidency was it under?</question>
  <answer>President Brigham Young.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>872</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it at the time of the reformation that Brigham Young issued the proclamation for all the wives, or that all the wives in the territory were free to leave their husbands?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that was not a revelation or proclamation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>873</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did he not preach that from the pulpit?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>874</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he make a statement to that effect that all the wives who wanted to leave their husbands could do so?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but I know what you are after. I remember what you mean, yes he did too. I remember it now, and I remember that it made some of the sisters pretty cross too, for they did not like it a bit, but then it did not amount to anything for there was nothing came of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>875</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you if all the sisters that came from this territory from Nauvoo, as far as you know, have been instructed that they must be rebaptized?</question>

  <question>Into this new and everlasting covenant?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was the same ceremony exactly that was before. The same ceremony that we were baptized into first.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>881</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it into the same covenant?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that we could be baptized back into something that we had never got out of, for we had not broken our covenants but we felt that there would be no harm done if we were baptized again, and so we were, but it was,</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>882</questionnumber>
  <question>Was what?</question>
  <answer>Was to a large extent optional with us.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>883</questionnumber>
  <question>What was optional?</question>
  <answer>Whether we should be baptized or not, - that is there was nothing obligatory about it, but it was recommended, but it was not compulsory.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>884</questionnumber>
  <question>now you say that this re-baptism was the same ceremony, - what do you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>The first baptism, - it was the same as the first ceremony of our baptism.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>885</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will read to you paragraphs three and four of section one hundred and thirty two of exhibit "A" on page three hundred and sixty four, and ask you to pay particular attention to it. - It is as follows, - "And verily I say unto you that the conditions of this law are these - - All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred) are of no efficacy, virtue or force, in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end, have an end when men are dead. Now that is the eighth section of the paragraph, - the eighth paragraph of the section I mean, and I will now read to you the third and fourth paragraphs of the same section, - "Therefore prepare they heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same; for behold I reveal unto you a new and everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this covenant, and he permitted to enter into my glory." Do you recognize that s a part of the revelation of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is a part of the revelation on marrying for time and eternity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>886</questionnumber>
  <question>Now are you willing to say that this is the new covenant, - are you willing to say now that this revelation teaches a new covenant?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>887</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a new covenant?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it is the same thing. It is the same covenant which we took when we went down into the water of baptism.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>888</questionnumber>
  <question>After you got to Salt Lake?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was the first time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>889</questionnumber>
  <question>The third paragraph which I have read says "therefore - prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same; for behold I reveal unto you a new and everlasting covenant, and if ye abide not in that covenant then are ye damned, for no one can reject this covenant and permitted to enter into my glory." This was received several years after you were baptized in 1837 was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, of course it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>890</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the instructions were to be given after that "for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same"?</question>
  <answer>Well what about that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>891</questionnumber>
  <question>Now was it not because of this revelation that you were baptized the second time out here?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but I had to be sealed to my husband for time and eternity, or else death would separate us.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>892</questionnumber>
  <question>Death would separate you?</question>
  <answer>
    Yes sir, and that is what it means

    </pagenumber>and nothing more in my opinion. 893 (Mistakenly listed as 895)
  </answer>
  <question>You believe and your church here teaches, that id you were not sealed to your husband for time and eternity, that you would be lost?</question>
  <answer>Please repeat that question, for I don't believe that I quite comprehend it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>894</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if you did not believe, and your church here did not teach, that if you were not sealed to your husband for time and eternity, that you would be lost?</question>
  <answer>No sir. No sir, we would not be lost, but we believe and our church teaches that a man cannot be exalted unless he has a wife, and a woman cannot be exalted unless she has a husband, - in other words they have to be married before they can be exalted.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>895</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will read the sixth paragraph?</question>
  <answer>Read it all - -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>896</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will read the sixth paragraph, as follows, - "And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fullness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fullness thereof, must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God." You have read that I suppose?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, well what do you want to know about it?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>897</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you understand that is teaching that this revelation is the new and everlasting covenant?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>898</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what you understand it to be?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, in that sense I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>899</questionnumber>
  <question>And you understand by the ninth paragraph which I have just read to you that after a man, - that if a woman refuses to abide by the law and be sealed, she will be damned?</question>
  <answer>I understand that she will not be exalted with her husband. I understand that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>900</questionnumber>
  <question>Well according to the revelation she will be damned won't she? Unless she receives it and is sealed to her husband she will be damned?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know that that is exactly what it says.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>901</questionnumber>
  <question>Well read the sixth paragraph and see what it says?</question>
  <answer>I heard you read it, and I don't know that it is necessary for me to read it. I can't read it anyway for I haven't my glasses here, - I know that I understand the law to be, to be sealed for time and eternity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>902</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will read it to you again, - "And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fullness of my glory, and he that receiveth a fullness thee of must and shall abide the law of he shall be damned"?</question>
  <answer>He must have his wife sealed to him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>903</questionnumber>
  <question>Or he shall be damned, - is not that what he says, - that "he must abide the law or he shall be damned." Is that not what he says?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and that means that his wife must be sealed to him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>904</questionnumber>
  <question>He will be damned if he does not receive the law?</question>
  <answer>Well that is a hard way of putting it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>905</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is the way it is there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>906</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will read now a little further?</question>
  <answer>That is right, - you will probably find polygamy in it a little further on.</answer>

  <question>
    "And verily I say unto you that the conditions of this law are these, - all covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associates or expectations, that are not made, and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy by revelation and commandment, through the medium of mine anointed whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this

    </pagenumber>power, and the keys of this priesthood are conferred) are of no efficacy, virtue or force, in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contrscts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead." What does that mean?
  </question>
  <answer>Well now that is strange, - can't you see through that easy enough.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>908</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now I don't know that I do , but I think I do. Under this revelation would not your covenants that you received in your baptism in 1837 be void unless you were re-baptized, - would not your original covenants have been void unless you had been re-baptized?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't think so, - it says there is but one man on earth at a time who has the power, - who holds the keys of that priesthood, and that man was Joseph at that time, and it means that at that time there was but one man on the earth who had the power to give a man more than one wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>909</questionnumber>
  <question>It was Joseph Smith at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>910</questionnumber>
  <question>And he had the power to give a man more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - through the power of revelation he did. When it was revealed to him he had the power of promulgating the decree of the Lord, but of course he did not have any power only what he received from God.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>911</questionnumber>
  <question>And after him it was Brigham Young who had the power?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>942</questionnumber>
  <question>After Joseph Smith died it was in Brigham Young, - the power was?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and now it is in President Woodruff.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>913</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know that?</question>
  <answer>That there tells it plain enough.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>914</questionnumber>
  <question>Does this say that the power that Joseph Smith held was conferred upon Brigham Young?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>915</questionnumber>
  <question>It does?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>916</questionnumber>
  <question>Where does it say that?</question>
  <answer>Well it don't say so in so many words, but in effect it does.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>917</questionnumber>
  <question>Did Brigham Young seal you to your husband?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>918</questionnumber>
  <question>In Joseph's day?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>919</questionnumber>
  <question>He sealed you to your husband while the prophet Joseph Smith was still living?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>920</questionnumber>
  <question>Why did he do that?</question>
  <answer>Because he had the power and authority to do so? If I had been a second wife Joseph would have had to have given me to him. Joseph would have to have done it, or have given him authority before he could have done it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>921</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't the revelation teach that no one except Joseph held the power to seal?</question>
  <answer>Not more than one wife without power to do it from Joseph.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>922</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they have that power under this revelation?</question>
  <answer>To seal a man's wife to him?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>923</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes madam?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but they did not have power to seal more than one wife to one man unless they had special authority to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>924</questionnumber>
  <question>Then Brigham Young did not seal you under this revelation, - Brigham Young did not seal you to your husband by virtue of this revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and he had authority to do so under that, for you see I was not a second wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>925</questionnumber>
  <question>But this doe snot say anything about a second wife or a first wife or anything of the kind?</question>
  <answer>
    Well there was but one man on earth at a time you see that could do anything about this revelation unless he could delegate his power to another. This revelation had nothing to do with the old order, - it applied to the new order, and the law that regulated a man and his one or first wife was the old law and under the Brigham had a right to seal me to my

    </pagenumber>husband, but under the new law as given in that revelation he could not seal a man's second or third wife to him without authority from Joseph to do so.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>926</questionnumber>
  <question>Well your sealing to your husband was not by virtue of this revelation, but by virtue of the other revelation whereby it was direct to seal a woman to her own husband?</question>
  <answer>Well of of course my husband had the liberty of take me, but then, - don't you see that you have gotten into polygamy now, - you are getting things mixed up, and we don't understand each other apparently.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>927</questionnumber>
  <question>This does not say a word about polygamy, - this revelation does not say a word about polygamy so far as I have read?</question>
  <answer>Well if you will read it through you will see.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>928</questionnumber>
  <question>Now could Brigham Young during the life-time of Joseph Smith, have performed the ordinance of sealing you to your husband under this revelation, when the revelation itself says there is not but one person on earth authorized to do so, and that is Joseph?</question>
  <answer>Well of course Joseph gave his consent, - of course he did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>929</questionnumber>
  <question>Could Joseph Smith seal by proxy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>930</questionnumber>
  <question>Oh he could?</question>
  <answer>Of course he could.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>931</questionnumber>
  <question>And could Brigham Young seal by proxy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, all of them could.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>932</questionnumber>
  <question>Could Wilford Woodruff seal by proxy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but he don't do it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>933</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you mean to say that a prophet was greater than the law, and could do as he pleased?</question>
  <answer>Well I mean to say just what that does there in the book.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>934</questionnumber>
  <question>Well this says that there is no man on earth could seal but Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>I know that, but if you will take the time to hunt it all out, you will find out just what it means.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>935</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you not, as a matter of fact, sealed to your husband after Joseph Smith's death, by Brigham Young?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>936</questionnumber>
  <question>You swear positively you was not?</question>
  <answer>I was not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>937</questionnumber>
  <question>And did you not go through the endowment house after Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>Through the temple I did but I was not sealed there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>938</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not pass through the endowment in the temple?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Yes sir, I meant to say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>939</questionnumber>
  <question>And take your obligations there in the temple?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>940</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you were sealed by Brigham Young after Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>There was no Brigham Young about it at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>941</questionnumber>
  <question>That ceremony was not conducted by Brigham Young?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>942</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it by?</question>
  <answer>Orson Hyde.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>943</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was after Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but I was sealed first by Brigham Young before Joseph's death. I was first sealed when Joseph was living.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>944</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you sealed under this revelation by Orson Hyde?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - under the covenants in this revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>945</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was after Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>946</questionnumber>
  <question>Now don't you know there is no other revelation on sealing?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>947</questionnumber>
  <question>That was not a plural wife revelation, and were you not sealed under that by Orson Hyde?</question>
  <answer>Well is this not the same thing?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>948</questionnumber>
  <question>I think not? I think the first one you were sealed under was a revelation that permitted a man's wife to be sealed unto himself only?</question>
  <answer>Well there wasn't any "only" about it at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>949</questionnumber>

  <mono>(Witness does not answer.) By Mr. P.P. Kelley,- "I desire to have it noted that Mr. Hall is shaking his head at the witness in a manner to indicate that he does not desire her to answer the question."</mono>
  <answer>I agreed not to reveal what transpired there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>989</questionnumber>
  <question>You understand that you are not called on to violate any promise or oath you made?</question>
  <answer>I can't say this ain't so or that ain't so, when I promised not to tell anything about it at all, and if I answer these questions I would be violating my agreement. (The foregoing question No. 989 was asked the witness in the way of instruction by Mr. Cabell.)</answer>

  <question>
    Now I will ask you to state to the reporter, if you can, why it was, or way it is, that the church of which Wilford Woodruff is not the president, and of which Brigham Young was formerly the president, published the revelation on polygamy, the same being sec-

    </pagenumber>tion one hundred and thirty two of exhibit "A" and incorporated that into the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and took out the book of doctrine and covenants published before that time section one hundred and one, the same being the section on marriage. Can you tell why that was done?
  </question>
  <answer>Why they took that out?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1007</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes madam, - can you tell why they went to work and took that out?</question>
  <answer>What you want to know is why they took that out, and put the other in its place?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1008</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes, why they took the revelation, or rather the section on marriage out and put this polygamous revelation in in its place?</question>
  <answer>You will have to ask some one else that question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1009</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know why it was done?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I don't know why it was done. I don't know why they did it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1010</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will ask you one more question, - since the "manifesto" was published, - I mean the manifesto renouncing polygamy was published by President Woodruff, has the church here re-adopted section one hundred and one of exhibit "E" as being the section on marriage?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and on the further ground that it is not proper re-cross examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1011</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you say to that?</question>
  <answer>I don't know anything about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1012</questionnumber>
  <question>Has the church adopted this as the section on marriage in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>I do not know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1013</questionnumber>
  <question>Have they ever done so to your knowledge?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1014</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the law of marriage is just the same now in this church here in Utah, as it was before the publication or issue of the manifesto of President Woodruf is concerned, - it is just the same as it was before the issue of that manifesto, so far as any public action of the church is concerned?</question>

  <question>I asked you if to your knowledge that section one hundred and one as it is in exhibit "E" had been put in the book of Doctrine and Covenants published by the church here, since the issue of the manifest by President Woodruff and you said that to your knowledge it had not; and now I ask you if it is not a fact that the law of the church here in Utah is the same as it was before the issuance of that manifesto by President Woodruff so far as any action taken by the church as a body is concerned?</question>

  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper re-cross examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1016</questionnumber>
  <question>So that the law of the church here in Utah is just the same as it was before that manifesto is concerned, - so far as any formal action of the church is concerned?</question>
  <answer>Well all that I know about it now is that there is not any such a thing as second wives at all now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1017</questionnumber>
  <question>Have they adopted any new revelation on that question of marriage? Has the church adopted any new revelations on the question of marriage that supersede, or displace that revelation, - that polygamous revelation?</question>
  <answer>The ceremony of marriage is the same with the first wife, or with the second one too for that matter. There is no reason why it should be changed at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1018</questionnumber>
  <question>Have they adopted, - that is has the church here adopted any new rule of marriage since the manifesto was issued?</question>
  <answer>Not that I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1019</questionnumber>
  <question>Then there is none except as it is contained in this revelation on polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Has no what, -</answer>

  <questionnumber>1020</questionnumber>
  <question>Has no law of the church on the question of marriage been adopted by the church since the issue of that manifesto, - has there any law been adopted by the church in the place of this revelation on polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Well, I don't know what you mean, for the manifesto is a law.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1021</questionnumber>
  <question>The manifesto itself you say is a law?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1022</questionnumber>
  <question>The manifesto is that you don't practice or take more than one wife, - is that it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That is what it says.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1023</questionnumber>
  <question>But if there are any marriages performed, were, or are they not married according to the provisions of the law contained in this section one hundred and thirty two, - married to one wife?</question>
  <answer>So far as that is concerned the marriage ceremony is and always has been the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1024</questionnumber>
  <question>The ceremony you say is and always has been the same?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1025</questionnumber>
  <question>They were sealed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for time and eternity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1026</questionnumber>
  <question>Then section one hundred and thirty two is operative in the church yet, so far as marriage is concerned, that is sealing one man and one wife?</question>
  <answer>Seal-on wife to one man, it is the woman who is sealed to the man, and not the man to the woman. So far as I am aware it is the same, -just the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1027</questionnumber>
  <question>Then section one hundred and thirty two is the law of the church on marriage, - that is in reference to sealing one man to one wife is concerned?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I suppose so, but I have not heard it talked of much, if any.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1028</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now is it not the law Mrs. Smith, except perhaps for the fact that the manifesto perhaps prohibits a man from taking more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes it does.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1029</questionnumber>
  <question>Does what?</question>
  <answer>The manifesto prohibits a man from having more than one wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1030</questionnumber>
  <question>But it is the law of the church just the same as it was before the manifesto was issued, excepting that one man cannot take but one wife, and can not have more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1031</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the law of the church at this time with this exception?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, so far as I know it is the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1032</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now suppose a man should take two wives now, what law of the church would be violated?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not re-cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>He would violate his covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1033</questionnumber>
  <question>What covenants?</question>
  <answer>When he raised his hand and covenanted to obey the ministry. Everybody did that at the time that manifesto was issued, and that is a covenant that he would violate if he would take two wives now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1034</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the law of the church though?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. There is no man in the church can take another wife without permission, and he cannot get permission, - he can't get the permission to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1035</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now that is not the answer to the question I asked you. Suppose a man did take two wives, where is the law of the church that would discipline him for it?</question>
  <answer>Well he would be cut off from the church for it?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1036</questionnumber>
  <question>By what law could that be done?</question>
  <answer>By reason of the fact that he violated his covenant in that manifesto.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1037</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that the law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1038</questionnumber>
  <question>What made it so?</question>
  <answer>Because they accepted it and swore to it.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>1039</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it they swore to?</question>
  <answer>The manifesto, - they swore to it and promised to obey it, and it is the law on that question. I thought you were not going to ask me any more questions.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1040</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I have thought of one or two more you see, but I did not know it at that time, - and my promise not to ask you anymore questions was a conditionsl one based upon your assenting to answer a question I asked you, which you refused to answer. It is because of an obligation that they took in the endowment to obey the counsel of the church?</question>
  <answer>Is that what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1041</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that the rule by which they would be disciplined?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1042</questionnumber>
  <question>That would not be the rule by which they would be disciplined?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1043</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what would be the rule?</question>
  <answer>By the action they took at the conference, and raised their hands and swore that they would obey the manifesto.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1044</questionnumber>
  <question>They swore that they would obey the manifesto?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, at the conference they did that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1045</questionnumber>
  <question>And you say that manifesto is the law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1046</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I think not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1047</questionnumber>
  <question>Does not the book of Doctrine and Covenants contain the laws of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but that is not in there I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1048</questionnumber>
  <question>Does not the book of Doctrine and Covenants contain all the laws of the church, - that is the law of the church with reference to the rules of disciplining?</question>
  <answer>Well no, I don't suppose it does. At any rate this manifesto has come out lately, and it is a law of the church that has not had time to be put in the Doctrine and Covenants. There is not at the present time anything in the book of Doctrine and Covenants about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1049</questionnumber>
  <question>Now the doctrine of the church has always been has it not Mrs. Smith, to be the bible, the book of Mormon and the book of Doctrine and Covenants, - these three books have been the doctrinal books of the church, have they not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1050</questionnumber>
  <question>And the book of Doctrine and Covenants contains the revelations that were given to the church by the Lord, through his prophet, Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1051</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the law of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1052</questionnumber>
  <question>Was the manifesto a revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1053</questionnumber>
  <question>Whom did it come through?</question>
  <answer>It came through the Lord.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1054</questionnumber>
  <question>The Lord speaking through whom?</question>
  <answer>Through Wilford Woodruff.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1055</questionnumber>
  <question>It was given to Wilford Woodruff?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1056</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know that to be a fact?</question>
  <answer>He said so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1057</questionnumber>
  <question>Who said so?</question>
  <answer>He said the Lord revealed it to him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1058</questionnumber>
  <question>Wilford Woodruff said that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, he said that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1059</questionnumber>
  <question>Said what?</question>
  <answer>Said that they had to stop that, and I have heard him say it privately too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1060</questionnumber>
  <question>Told them they had to stop polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that they had to stop having more than one wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1061</questionnumber>
  <question>is it the same thing as the Lord told Abraham when he told him to put away Hagar?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it is the same thing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1062</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Then the Lord communicated through President Woodruff to the church, that they had to stop the practice of polygamy, and put their surplus wives away, - how was it to be stopped? If the Lord in the first place authorized the practice of polygamy in

    </pagenumber>the church, and then afterwards interdicted it, would you not think that the Lord was rather gone back on himself?
  </question>
  <answer>It is not for me to criticize the Lord's actions.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1063</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if he authorized polygamy in the first place and if it is an institution of the Lord it must be one that he authorizes or approves, else he would not permit it, and then he afterwards goes back on it, does it not look like he would be going back on himself?</question>
  <answer>I say it is not for me,</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, and is calling for an expression of opinion from the witness.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>1064</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't think so. I don't think so at all. I think the people have gone back on it themselves.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1065</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is it not more consistent to believe that the polygamous revelation was a fraud than to believe that the Lord would go back on himself in that way?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for it is not a fraud.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1066</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you said that the manifesto was a revelation from the Lord?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1067</questionnumber>
  <question>Given to the church through Wilford Woodruff?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1068</questionnumber>
  <question>And you say also that the polygamous revelation was a revelation from God to the church through Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1069</questionnumber>
  <question>Now if that polygamous revelation was not a fraud why does the Lord step in and say that the people must stop that which they were commanded to do by the polygamous revelation, - why does he step in and say that they must not do that which they are directed and commanded to do in the polygamous revelation?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper re-cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Well it is not the first time he has done that a and it is all right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1070</questionnumber>
  <question>When did he ever step in at any other time and tell you that you must stop practicing polygamy?</question>
  <answer>He told the Nephites the same thing.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1074</questionnumber>
  <question>Did the Lord ever tell the Nephites to commence the practice of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>I don't know. I suppose he did. He told them to stop it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1075</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you know he did?</question>
  <answer>Well it don't say in the book of Mormon that he told them to commence it but it says that he told them not practice it until, - he puts it "without I the Lord command thee" or something like that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1076</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you certain that is in the book of Mormon that way?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1077</questionnumber>
  <question>That they must not practice polygamy without the Lord commanded them to do so?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>I think the evidence shows that she is capable of answering not only this question but a great many others that she had refused or declined to answer. If she is not competent, I would like to know who is? What do you say to the question I asked you?</question>
  <answer>Well if you will read that you will see that it is true.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1080</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now I will read from exhibit "B" on page 132 paragraphs 24, -23, 24, and 25, and I will ask you if that is the part of the book of Mormon you referred to, - "But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold thus saith the Lord, - this people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures for they begin to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which are written concerning David and Solomon his son. Behold David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord. Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph. Wherefore, I, the Lord God, will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old. Wherefore, brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord, for there shall not any man among you have, save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none. For I, the Lord God delighteth in the chastity of women, and whoredoms are an abomination before me, thus saith the Lord of Hosts. Wherefore this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes. For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things. For behold I the Lord have seen the sorrow the heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem; yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness and abominations of their husbands." Now I heave read to you from the 23rd paragraph to the 31st paragraph inclusive?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is it there, - there it is entirely.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1081</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that the part of the book of Mormon you referred to when you said the Lord commanded them not to take more wives than one?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir, it says it plain enough.</answer>

  <question>Don't the very passages I have rad condemn the practice of polygamy wherever it had been started?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1086</questionnumber>
  <question>It does not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for it talked like as if it was all right in the beginning.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1087</questionnumber>
  <question>He said "behold David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me", and then to show who was speaking it goes on to show that the Lord said that, - the words are "thus saith the Lord"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but you read there that they began to be wicked, and that shows that they were not that way in the beginning, but after a while they began to wax wicked.</answer>

  <answer>They had been practicing it according to this, but they had run it into wickedness, and he gave them a revelation commanding them to stop it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1089</questionnumber>

  <question>Mrs Young have you any positive knowledge that the property conveyed in that deed was church property?</question>
  <answer>No sir, - I have no positive knowledge about that as I said before, but I always supposed it was. I know we always considered that the property was church property, and we made no claim to it as being our property, for we supposed all the time it was church property.</answer>

  <question>How old were you when you lived in Missouri when that property was purchased by your father?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know. That is hard for me to say. When I first went to Missouri I was only about seven years old, and I guess the property was purchased about that time. I don't know anything about the purchase of it though, for I was too young at the time to pay much attention to things like that.</answer>

  <question>The year I mean? Can you remember the year you first went to Missouri?</question>

  <answer>Well now I could not say for sur that he was. I couldn't say whether he was born in Jackson County, or after we left there. Yell now I remember he was born there, but I couldn't say for sure that he was born on that lot we loved on at that time.</answer>

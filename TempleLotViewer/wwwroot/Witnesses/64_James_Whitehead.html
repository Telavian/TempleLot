  <mono>By P.P. Kelley: Let the record show that the plaintiffs paid the fees of the Willard Griffith being for one hundred and fifty miles at ten cents per mile and for three days attendance as a witness. By Mr. Southern: It is not claimed that Griffith was supoenaed in this case, is it? By Mr. P.P. Kelley: No sir, it is not claimed that he was subpoenaed and if you want to make and objection to those fees, you can do so. Let the record also show that the fees of John Hawley were paid for the plaintiff. He lives at Sheridan, Missori, and it is one hundred and fifty miles from here, and he was four days in attendance as a witness. By Mr. Southern: Just enter our objection to the allowance of these fees. There is a matter I wish to call your attention to, and it is this: I believe the stipulations that have been filed regarding the taking of these depositions require that they shall all be filed before the first of September, or by that date. Now it is a physical impossibility to have them done by that time, in fact I think it will take until the first of October for me to transcribe my notes, possibly longer, and I would like to know what you propose doing about it. The stipulations will have to be varied, or the time extended for filing the depositions, for it is absolutely impossible to transcribe my notes in that time. By Mr. Kelley: Well, we all have copies of the testimony, and I suppose it don't make any difference so long as the transcript is on file before the court convenes. By the Notary: I understood, and I think it is on record somewhere in these depositions, that I was to have all the time necessary to prepare the transcript, but as I am a little in doubt about it, I thought it best to call your attention to it at this time, for I might forget to do so. I understood also that the stipulations in that respect would be waived for the reason that both parties were getting copies of all the testimony taken, and that one of the reasons the time was fixed for filing the testimony at the time it is, was because the parties desired to have the testimony where they could have access to it, but owing to the fact that they had copies, it was not necessary to insist upon it, nor advisable to do so. By Mr. Kelley: That is satisfactory to us also. By the Notary: Then I shall proceed to write up the transcript and file it as soon as I get it completed, indexed, and compared, and I will be as diligent as I can in that work. I may have it done by the middle of September, and it may be the first of October. It will all depend on how much more evidence you gentlemen are going to take. By Mr. Traber, Well, if that matter is settled, I shall proceed with the examination of Mr. Whitehead.</mono>

  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "Right here I want to enter an objection to any attempt to prove that a doctrine of that kind did not exist, or did exist by negative testimony, for I don't think that it is the kind of testimony that comes within the rules of testimony.

  <questionnumber>51</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what were the duties he performed?</question>
  <answer>Well I was in the possession of Joseph's private papers, in a desk I had them and I had the key to that desk myself, and William Clayton was more of a clerk and attended to a great deal of the business on the outside. That is about the difference.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>52</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was he Joseph Smith's private secretary in any sense of the word?</question>

  <answer>It was in 1843 in the beginning of the year.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>60</questionnumber>
  <question>Well not then, - what was the nature of the other employment that he was engaged in. I mean that Clayton was engaged in?</question>
  <answer>Why it was going out and attending to business generally. There was a good deal of business done in regard tot he lots and farms of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>61</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was the nature of that business?</question>
  <answer>Well the church would buy in property and sell it out again, and he attended to most of that business. I did not attend to that at all, and Clayton would look after that sir.</answer>

  <question>You have heard of that?</question>

  <answer>
    Well I could not tell you the date that I first heard of it, that is the time of the year, but it was in 1848, - in the early part of the year, I think, - it might possibly be the latter part of '32, for I would not be positive about the date, that I first heard of that ordinance, the sealing as they called it of husband and wife. They would be married according to the ordinances of the laws of God, not only for time, but

      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0002_f0008-Pages_92-193-ORIGINAL/7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 97</a>
    </pagenumber>for eternity as well.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>67</questionnumber>
  <question>They would be married for time and eternity as well?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but that applied only to husband and wife and a man could not have but one wife, - they were not allowed to have more than one wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>68</questionnumber>
  <question>A man was allowed, then, to have but one wife, and he would be sealed to her for hit life as well as the life to come?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>69</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that ordinance the result of a revelation?</question>
  <answer>I do not understand about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>70</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was the authority for that ordinance derived from a revelation?</question>
  <answer>Why it was according to scripture, -according to what was written. It was a setting apart, - not only uniting - but they were bound to stick together, unless they were divided by the law of the land, for we never went against the law of the land in anything.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>71</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know anything at all in reference to a revelation on sealing?</question>
  <answer>That is all I know about it, - what I have told you is all I know about it sir. Perhaps I don't quite understand what you want.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>72</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I don't think you do either?</question>
  <answer>Well ask me the question again and then perhaps I will understand you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>73</questionnumber>
  <question>What I want to know is this, whether the prophet or whether you ever saw or heard of what was claimed to be a revelation on this subject from Whitney or any body else?</question>
  <answer>With regard to polygamy?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>74</questionnumber>
  <question>No sir, - with regard to sealing?</question>
  <answer>Why that was the law of the Lord. It was the law of God as it is written, but it was to be done in the spirit of holiness, - in the purity of the spirit of holiness, but it only applied to a man and his wife, and they could be sealed to each other for time and for eternity, and that bond could not be broken only by the law of the land.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>75</questionnumber>
  <question>Did Whitney ever show you a revelation on any subject whatever?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, he showed me a revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>76</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was it?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, I can't repeat it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I don't ask you to repeat it. I asked you what subject it was on?</question>
  <answer>It was on what we are talking about now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>78</questionnumber>
  <question>I understood you to say that you did not know of any revelation upon that subject?</question>
  <answer>I don't know what you mean by "revelation on that subject."</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>79</questionnumber>
  <question>Well sir, I mean simply a revelation on the subject of sealing? That is what I mean?</question>
  <answer>Well that was all the subject that was talked about as far as I remember.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>80</questionnumber>
  <question>I understood you to say that the sealing was founded upon the scriptures?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, so it was. It is founded upon the scriptures.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>81</questionnumber>
  <question>You say that Whitney showed you a revelation at one time?</question>
  <answer>He did sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>82</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now what had this rexelation of Witneys to do with the matter of sealing?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is what the revelation showed, and the Lord says so by his written law too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>83</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was in the revelation that Whitney showed you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Yes sir, that was in the revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>84</questionnumber>
  <question>And Whitney showed you the revelation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>85</questionnumber>
  <question>To whom was that revelation given?</question>
  <answer>To Joseph Smith sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>86</questionnumber>
  <question>It was given to Joseph Smith?</question>

  <questionnumber>87</questionnumber>
  <question>You are sure of that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>88</questionnumber>
  <question>Well can you tell any more definitely what its contents were?</question>
  <answer>Oh I don't know any further than it was on that subject of plural marriage, but I can't repeat it for it has been so long since I saw it. I remember that it was before they went to Salt Lake.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>89</questionnumber>
  <question>What was before they went to Salt Lake?</question>
  <answer>That Whitney showed me that. It was before they went to Salt Lake, for at that time they had arranged to go to Salt Lake, or I should say to go westward into the wilderness, for at that time they did not know they were going to Salt Lake.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>90</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it before or after the prophet's death?</question>
  <answer>It was after the prophet's death. It was after Joseph't death that he showed me that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>91</questionnumber>
  <question>Under what circumstances did he come to show you that?</question>
  <answer>I went up to winter quarters or to Omaha to settle my account with the church and make my report. That was after they had left Nauvoo and were in winter quarters at Omaha or near there. Well as I said I went up there to make my report, and I did not stay there, for as I said when I was giving my testimony before I saw things going on there that I did not like, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>92</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you need not state what caused you to leave there, but go ahead and state what you saw there, - what were the circumstances I mean under which you came to see this revelation?</question>
  <answer>Well as I said I was there to make my settlement with the church, and while I was there, before I left, I went and stayed all night with Bishop Whitney, and he showed it to me then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>93</questionnumber>
  <question>Now when was that?</question>
  <answer>That was in the spring of 1848.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>94</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know when the revelation purported to have been given?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't recollect the date, - that is I don't recollect the date positively, but as far as my recollection goes it was in 1842, - I think it was about 1842. Now I am not positive about that, but I think it was about 1842.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>95</questionnumber>
  <question>how much of a document was it?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, it was as much about as would fill this leaf, - both sides of it (referring to a sheet of fool's cap paper) I should think it was about three sides of a sheet of paper like that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>96</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it in manuscript?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was written.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>97</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you write it?</question>
  <answer>I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>98</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if you wrote it?</question>

  <question>Well did you read it?</question>
  <answer>I did sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>100</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you recollect whose handwriting it was in?</question>
  <answer>Well I would not be positive, but I think it was William Clayton's. I could not tell in a moment if I could see it for certain, but I think now it was in William Clayton's, I am not sure about that, but I think it was in Clayton's hand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>101</questionnumber>
  <question>Since that time have you seen it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I haven't seen it since that time, for I haven't been near them since then.</answer>

  <question>Was it ever printed that you know of?</question>
  <answer>I never saw it printed. I saw what they claimed was it, or what purported to be it, that was published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants published by the Brighamite church in Salt Lake.</answer>

  </question>
  <answer>No sir, it was not the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>105</questionnumber>
  <question>What difference was there in them?</question>
  <answer>It was not the same at all. It was entirely changed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>106</questionnumber>
  <question>It was changed you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you tell in what particular it was changed?</question>
  <answer>It was changed so that it sanctioned polygamy, and that change was made by the Brighamites, for there was no such a thing in it when it came from Joseph the martyr. You can find it for yourself in the book of Doctrine and Covenants published by the Brighamites at Salt Lake, and you will see in it as published by them that it sanctions and imposes polygamy on the church, but there was not such thing in the revelation that Whitney showed me, - nothing of the kind at all sir. I remember when I first saw that revelation, they have in their books of Doctrine and Covenants, for it was brought to me by a man from Salt Lake, and he showed it to me, and asked me what I thought of it, and I told him that it was spurious.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>108</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you recognize that revelation as published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants from Salt Lake, - did you recognize it as the revelation you had seen at winter quarters?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I told you it was not the same, - that it was changed so that it sanctioned polygamy, and there was nothing about polygamy or plural marriage in the revelation that Whitney showed me. It was changed entirely.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>109</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I know you say that, but did it have, or did you recognize in the revelation published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants published by the Utah Mormon Church any part of the revelation that was shown you when you were at winter quarters?</question>
  <answer>It was entirely changed, but there was some points of similarity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>110</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know it was changed?</question>
  <answer>Well it did not have the same language at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>111</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now might it not have been an entirely new revelation?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I could not tell about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>112</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that might be the case might it not?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not say about that, for there were some parts of it if it was the same, that were turned and twisted around and warped so that they had another meaning entirely from what the one had that Whitney showed me. I know that I considered when I read it that they had got that revelation from Bishop Whitney, and they had changed it entirely and added to it a great deal. I know that for it had nothing to do with polygamy when it came from Joseph Smith. On the contrary it was entirely opposed to it, but they had changed it around until they had made it sanction polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>113</questionnumber>
  <question>You refer to the purported revelation published by the Salt Lake church, when you say the revelation was changed so as to countenance polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and the revelation that Whitney had did not say anything about polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>114</questionnumber>
  <question>And is that revelation the revelation under which polygamy was practiced in the Salt Lake church?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, all I know about that is what I have heard. I never was there and I don't know what they did practice there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>115</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if they practiced polygamy was it under that revelation it was done?</question>

  <answer>Well I say that that revelation that was published in their book of Doctrine and Covenants sanctioned it, but there was nothing about polygamy in that revelation that bishop Whitney had, and I think they took that revelation that Whitney had and changed it so that it read to sanction polygamy, and now they try to pass it off as one of Joseph Smith's revelations.</answer>

  <question>The revelation as you saw it at winter quarters bore a date did it not??</question>
  <answer>I could not say, I don't remember much about a date for I just read the revelation, and the man that gave it to me asked me what I thought about it, and I told him it was not right, - that it was spurious and a fraud, and that Joseph Smith never gave that.</answer>

  <question>When that revelation was handed to you at Omaha for your perusal, was there anything said to you at that time about where it had been kept from the time it was given down to the time you saw it?</question>

  <answer>No sir, and I did not ask him when he got it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>128</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did he say about that?</question>
  <answer>He said that Joseph gave it to him to keep and take care of. That is all that I know about that.</answer>

  <question>What reason have you for thinking that that revelation that you saw at winter quarters was a part of the revelation incorporated in the book of Doctrine and Covenants published by the Utah church?</question>
  <answer>Well I will tell you what the reason was, - because the man that had it told me that that was the revelation of Bishop Whitney, I mean that the revelation that Bishop Whitney had, and that it was put in the book of Covenants. Now that is all that I know about it.</answer>

  <answer>Where did I reside with reference to Joseph Smith's home?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>131</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>Oh, I lived maybe three hundred yards from where he lived.</answer>

  <answer>Oh I saw him every day.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>134</questionnumber>
  <question>You saw him every day you say?</question>
  <answer>Well perhaps not every day, but I saw him almost every day that he was in Nauvoo. I saw him on Sunday, because if I was not busy I would go and hear him preach, and as I did not make a practice of doing any work on Sunday in the office I generally went to hear him preach.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>135</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you have testified that you were in the office of the prophet down to the time of his death?</question>
  <answer>I was sir. I was there in his office at the time that he was murdered.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>136</questionnumber>
  <question>Right up to the time of his death you were in his office, and acted in the capacity of private secretary for him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I was in his office at the time he was killed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>137</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were you in his office at the time he was killed, or were you at Carthage where he was killed?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I was not at Carthage. I was in his office on that day, and I was keeping the books at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>138</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you were not present at the time he was killed.</question>
  <answer>No sir, I was not at Carthage, I was not there when he was killed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>139</questionnumber>
  <question>How many days had he been gone from Nauvoo before he was killed?</question>
  <answer>Well it was but a very short time. I remember the circumstance very well and he was gone but a very short time, for I know that the governor came down there to Nauvoo and made a speech to the people. I remember that right well for he said in that speech that "stands as though it was over one hundred kegs of powder, and if you don't give up Mr. Smith you must take the consequences", and he had left there before that, and the time that the governor was making that speech Joseph and Hyrum was shot dead at the Carthage jail.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>140</questionnumber>
  <question>I don't quite understand you when you say that they demanded that they should be given up?</question>
  <answer>I said that he demanded that Joseph Smith should be given up.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>141</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I understand that, but I don't understand how he should demand that they must be given up when he were already in the jail at Carthage?</question>
  <answer>
    Well he did say so. I understand that is another speech you have reference to. You must understand that the governor was there more than once, for he was there at Nauvoo two or three times making speeches. It was Joseph was given up that he made that inflammatory speech about the powder and when would happen if he was not given up. I remember that now, for they gave themselves up, or rather went to Carthage and gave themselves up, and it is my opinion that it was right the next afternoon they were shot. At any rate they were there but a very short time before they were murdered. I remember that the Governor came down again and he made another speech, and he told the citizens that they must be careful and keep the law, and made a long speech, and while he was there making that speech both Hyrum and Joseph Smith were shot dead in cold blood in the Carthage jail, and Willard Richards and John Taylor were there also, and John Taylor

  <questionnumber>171</questionnumber>
  <question>—Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>—Yes sir, I swear it is not the same, for that revelation that Whitney had there had no such words in it to my knowledge. Not the part which I read I know, and if it was ever put into it it was put into it by Brigham Young or some of his clique, for it was not in there at the time that Whitney showed it to me, of that I am positive.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>172</questionnumber>
  <question>—What was not in it?</question>
  <answer>—That part which I have read, That is the first time I ever have seen that to remember it I think. I saw this revelation or alleged revelation before, but this is the first time that my attention was called specially to this particular part of it sir, and I know that that was not in the revelation that Whitney showed me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>173</questionnumber>
  <question>—Well I believe you stated that there was enough of the Whitney revelation, or the revelation which he showed you, in this revelation in the Utah book of Doctrine and Covenants for you to identify it?</question>

    </pagenumber>that there were words and sections or paragraphs added to it in such a manner as to entirely change its meaning, that is what I said sir. I said that they were mixed up in such a manner and manipulated so as to change its meaning entirely sir. There has been a word or two taken from one place, and some more from another, and it has been warped around so to change its meaning entirely if it is the same, which I don't say is the case.

  <questionnumber>177</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not say that there was enough of the original language in it to identity it, for you to identify it as having been the original revelation?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I said that they had taken parts of that revelation perhaps, and had added to it in such a way as to change its meaning entirely. I did not say that was the same revelation, and I don't know now that it is or that it is not, but if there is any part of the revelation that Whitney showed me in this, it has been so mutilated and changed around as to entirely change the meaning from what it originally was.</answer>

  <answer>Yes sir, and that was enough for me to know. That was my opinion the first time I saw this one here in this book, and it is my opinion now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>179</questionnumber>
  <question>At what time did you read this Salt Lake revelation so called?</question>
  <answer>I read it, let me see, I read it five or six years ago. There was a man at Belleville and he can tell you for he showed it to me, and his name is Joseph Betts, Joseph Betts, senior. He showed it to me out of the Book of Covenants from Salt Lake, and that was the first time I had seen it, for I never was there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>180</questionnumber>
  <question>You mean that you were never at Salt Lake?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I never was there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>181</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was five or six years ago?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, maybe six or seven years ago, and maybe not so long and maybe it was longer ago than that. I can't be positive as to the length of time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>182</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you see it in the hands of Whitney?</question>
  <answer>Which one?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>183</questionnumber>
  <question>There is only the one that I understood you to say that Whitney had, and now I ask you when it was that you saw the one that he had in his hands?</question>
  <answer>That was in 1848.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>184</questionnumber>
  <question>What time in the year was it?</question>
  <answer>It was in the spring of the year at the time that I was leaving Salt Lake. I mean Omaha, or winter quarters. I stopped there before I left with Whitney all night, and I read it then, for he gave it to me to read.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>185</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you leave there?</question>
  <answer>Winter quarters do you mean?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>186</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>Well that was in the spring of 1848 and I left there the next morning, for I stopped with Bishop Whitney the night before I left there for good. I just happened accidentally to stop there with him that night, for I should have gone away the night before, but I could not get over the river for th ferry had stopped, and that was the reason that I stopped with Whitney as I did, and that was the time and the only time I read it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>187</questionnumber>
  <question>How many times did you read it?</question>
  <answer>Once.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>188</questionnumber>
  <question>Having read it but one, are you prepared to say from memory, after the lapse of nearly or quite forty years, are you prepared to say that the revelation published in the Utah book of Doctrine and Covenants has been changed from the revelation that Bishop Whitney showed you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I say if it is the same revelation it has been very greatly changed from what it was when I read it at Bishop Whitney's house.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>189</questionnumber>
  <question>Now upon what do you base for that?</question>
  <answer>Well I can not understand that question.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>190</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you upon what basis you based that opinion?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't tell you other than my remembrance of these things. I can remember whether a thing contains certain matters after forty years. Now take that so called revelation in this book, - if you were to ask me forty years hence if it had been changed. I could tell you, for if there had been any material change in it I would remember it. That revelation as it is now teaches polygamy, and if it is changed by taking that out of it, I would remember it although I might not see it for forty years, and I would be able to tell you that there is a change in it too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>191</questionnumber>
  <question>You never saw that revelation but the one time, and that was at winter quarters, and in the hands of Bishop Whitney?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>192</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that the only time you saw it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>193</questionnumber>
  <question>And you read it once?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>194</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it written in a good clear hand?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>195</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it written in black ink or blue ink?</question>
  <answer>In black ink.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>196</questionnumber>
  <question>You are sure of that?</question>
  <answer>I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>197</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know who it had been written by?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>198</questionnumber>
  <question>Who had written it?</question>
  <answer>I told you that I thought it had been written by Clayton.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>199</questionnumber>
  <question>By W. William Clayton?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>200</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you see him and ask him about it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for he was not there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>201</questionnumber>
  <question>Why should he have written that?</question>
  <answer>I don't know anything about that and I did not ask him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>202</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you know his hand writing?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I did know his hand writing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>203</questionnumber>
  <question>You say it was in William Clayton's hand writing?</question>
  <answer>I say I think it was, but I don't say that positively, for others might write the same, - I don't know anything about that, but I think it was his hand writing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>204</questionnumber>
  <question>Now could you thirty five or forty years ago read over a page of manuscript, and remember what was in it so well as to testify forty years afterwards what was in it so well, as to testify what was in it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I could at that time, and I can tell you things now that transpired over fifty years ago. Now I don't say mind you, that I could do it forty years hence.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>205</questionnumber>
  <question>You say then that you could read over two or three pages of manuscript forty years ago, and tell what was in it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, if it was something that particularly impressed itself on my memory, and that was some thing that left a very strong impression on my mind, for that was the first time I had seen that revelation on sealing, and the only time I saw it, and I was interested in it to a great extent, and I observed it closely, and I remember about what the doctrine was that was taught, and I know that this doctrine of polygamy was not taught in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>206</questionnumber>
  <question>Could you recollect it accurately?</question>
  <answer>I could remember when I saw it whether it was the same or not, if it was anything like that sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>207</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you willing to rely on your memory in relation to this matter and testify that these revelations we not the same, - that is that the revelation that Whitney showed you was not the same as this published in this book?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I would swear positively that they were not the same at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>208</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Well wait a moment, - are you wiling to say that forty years after you had read two or three pages of a manuscript that you are able to capable of identifying what purports to be that manu-

    </pagenumber>script or a copy of that manuscript?
  </question>
  <answer>In what way?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>209</questionnumber>
  <question>In any way, - from memory?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I can to some extent, I can tell, for I know what you mean, - I can tell that there are principles taught in this book here in this alleged revelation that are not taught, - I mean were not taught in that revelation that Whitney had. I know that of my own knowledge sir, and you can make what you please out of it. Now wait, don't interrupt me, - give me a chance to explain myself, - I have given you the reasons as to why I would be more than likely to remember this rexelation and what was in it that Whitney showed me, and I do remember it, and I know that the principles that were taught in the one that Whitney showed me, are not in this one in this book, and if it is the same revelation it has been added to and changed so that there is not the same meaning in it that was in the original. I say, mark you, if it is the same, for I don't say that it is the same, by any means.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>210</questionnumber>
  <question>Well they are not the same?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for that did not teach any such stuff as this here in this book, not any like stuff.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>211</questionnumber>
  <question>Then I understand you to say also that you remember the language of that manuscript so well that you can tell that some of the language that was in that manuscript is in this Salt Lake book?</question>
  <answer>Is in there?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>212</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>In that book?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>213</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, in that Salt Lake book?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, there is some of it in it I think, or something like it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>214</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it is a fact that you remember it so well that you can remember some of the language that was in there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>215</questionnumber>
  <question>And some of it had been changed, - you remember that also?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it has been changed, and a good deal put in there that was not in there at all, - that is some has been put in that was not in the manuscript some has been put in that was not in the manuscript at all, - that is assuming that they are the same, for I don't say that any part of this manuscript was put in this book at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>216</questionnumber>
  <question>Well assuming that it was it has been changed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it has been changed from what it was there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>217</questionnumber>
  <question>But some of it is the same?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>218</questionnumber>
  <question>Were there any other principles taught in what you read from the Utah book of Doctrine and Covenants but the principles of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say. I never read but that one principle, for I did not have it any time, - I was disgusted with it when I read it. I just read it the one time and handed it back to the man who had given it to me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>219</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that piece you looked at just one part or just one section?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, he just handed it to me and asked me what I thought about it, and I expressed my opinion and handed it back to him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>220</questionnumber>
  <question>You read it of course before you expressed your opinion?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, certainly I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>221</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not look at any thing only what he called your attention to?</question>
  <answer>That is all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>222</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was on the question of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>223</questionnumber>
  <question>Well as it was a very important matter, as you regarded it, this doctrine of polygamy, why is it that you did not when you first saw how the Utah church was - using it, or handling it, why did you not then look over all that was said?</question>
  <answer>
    I did not have any interest in it at all. It was a matter of no special interest to me, for I knew long before that from what I had heard the position they had taken and what the claimed and taught. I had nothing to do with them and I would not be with them on account of their wick-

    </pagenumber>edness. I did not care anything about them or what they taught for I knew they were lost in their wickedness.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>224</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you did not care whether they practiced polygamy or not?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>225</questionnumber>
  <question>Why did you not take an interest in that?</question>
  <answer>Well I did not care anytging about it for that was their business, and not mine, and I did not see that I had any particular interest in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>226</questionnumber>
  <question>It was a matter of indifference to you then?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not exactly that, for I knew that I could not do anything with them and I did not have to answer for their crimes.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>227</questionnumber>
  <question>Your conscience was easy on that score?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir perfectly easy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>228</questionnumber>
  <question>You have testified here today as to what you understood sealing between husband and wife to be?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>229</questionnumber>
  <question>What was that?</question>
  <answer>They were to be married according to the ordinances, - that is all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>230</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then did sealing mean marriage?</question>
  <answer>That is what I understand it to be, and that is about all I did or do know about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>231</questionnumber>
  <question>Sealing then was not only for time but for eternity as well?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that was what was provided for in that ordinance.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>232</questionnumber>
  <question>Who could be sealed?</question>
  <answer>It was for husband and wife that was all, - they could be sealed for time and eternity, and they were the only ones that could be sealed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>233</questionnumber>
  <question>that was done through a revelation?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>234</questionnumber>
  <question>The authority for that was through a revelation through Joseph Smith, was it not?</question>
  <answer>That was done by the authority of the church sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>235</questionnumber>
  <question>It was authorized by the church then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>236</questionnumber>
  <question>And not by a revelation?</question>
  <answer>They said it was by a revelation, but I never read it, and I don't know what it was for I never had anything to do with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>237</questionnumber>
  <question>Your garments were clear from sin?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they are clear from polygamy entirely. There is no taint of polygamy on my garments, - I have kept clear of that sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>238</questionnumber>
  <question>Now what I was going to ask you was this, - how if a man was sealed for time and eternity to his present wife, and she died and he married another, and he was sealed to her, - how would it be in the hereafter with that woman?</question>
  <answer>Oh I don't know that they were that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>239</questionnumber>
  <question>Well wait a moment, - would not that man have two wives in eternity?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, I don't know. I could not say anything about that for I never knew of a circumstance of that kind. I will tell you what I think sir, - I believe that polygamy was from the devil from the beginning, and that is my opinion and I don't care who knows it either sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>240</questionnumber>
  <question>Now under that revelation did not a man have a right, if he was a member of the church, did not - a man have a right to be sealed to his wife?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>241</questionnumber>
  <question>He did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir, he had a right to have his wife sealed to him.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>242</questionnumber>
  <question>Well suppose that a man had one wife, and she was sealed to him and then died, and then he married another woman how would it be?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>243</questionnumber>
  <question>

    </pagenumber>sealed to him and she died, and then he married another wife, - how would that be then?
  </question>
  <answer>Well that would be all right, - but I don't know much about that, - I did not have anything to do with the business of sealing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>244</questionnumber>
  <question>Well would not that man have two wives in eternity?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>245</questionnumber>
  <question>Why not?</question>
  <answer>Because they would not seal two wives to him for eternity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>246</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how do you know that?</question>
  <answer>Well that is what they said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>247</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was there not a revelation to that effect?</question>
  <answer>I don't know anything about it, - I did not read the revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>248</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now is it not a fact that this practice or doctrine of polygamy grew out of that sealing doctrine, and that they were sealed as you have suggested for eternity, and being sealed for eternity, was not the next subject and suggestion, that if they were sealed for eternity they might also be married for time?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't answer that question, for I don't know anything about it sir. I can't answer that question for it is something I don't know anything about.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>249</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is it a fact that if Joseph Smith had any extra wives, or other wives than Emma Smith, if he did that, - had these extra wives and practiced it, - that in practiced polygamy, he would not be likely to let you see him at it?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't believe he ever did any such a thing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>250</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if he did that he would not have let you know anything about it - it is altogether probably that he would not let you know anything about it if he could prevent it?</question>
  <answer>Well I say I don't believe he ever did any such a thing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>251</questionnumber>
  <question>Well sir, answer my question, - is it likely that when he practiced polygamy - if he did practice it, that he would have invited you to witness it?</question>
  <answer>I don't believe that he ever did practice it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>252</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is it probable that he would have invited you to see him practice it?</question>
  <answer>I don't know anything about that. 253 (Written as 233)</answer>
  <question>Well now answer that question, - is it probably that he would have invited you to witness it, - to witness his practicing it?</question>
  <answer>Well I say I don't know. I don't think he is guilty of practicing it sir. I don't believe he was ever guilty of practicing it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>254</questionnumber>
  <question>Well supposing that he was guilty of it, would he have invited you to witness his practicing it?</question>
  <answer>I can't answer supposed cases.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>255</questionnumber>
  <question>You decline to answer that question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for I can't answer it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>256</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now does it follow that because you did not see him practice polygamy, that he did not practice it?</question>
  <answer>I told you that I did not believe that he ever practiced it, and I told you that he never taught it to me not to anyone else that I knew of, and that I never heard him say anything about it one way or the other.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>257</questionnumber>
  <question>He did not talk to you about it?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>258</questionnumber>
  <question>Now the question is, - you say you did not hear him say anything about it one way or the other?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>259</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I am not denying that, but the question is, does it follow that he did not practice it because you did not see him practice it?</question>
  <answer>I can't answer these questions because I don't know anything about it. 260 (Written as 360)</answer>
  <question>
    Well I will ask you this as matter of reason, and

    </pagenumber>within the workings of your own mind, - does the fact that you did not see him practice polygamy, prove to the satisfaction of your own mind that he did not practice it?
  </question>
  <answer>I cannot say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>261</questionnumber>
  <question>You have no answer to make to that at all?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I have nothing to say to that at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>262</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then you say you never spoke to him about polygamy?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and he never spoke to me about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>263</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will ask you this question, - did Joseph Smith know that you were opposed to the practice of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>How could he know it when he never mentioned it to me one way or the other. There never was anything said about it between us, and he could scarcely know that I was opposed to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>264</questionnumber>
  <question>he did not talk to you about it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, he never did. He never mentioned it to me one way or the other, and I think I have told you that at least a dozen times.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>265</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you think that his confidence in you was so great, that if he had more than one wife, or a dozen wives, that he would keep the accounts of these wives there with you, or allow you to keep them for him?</question>
  <answer>Well I know that I never did keep any accounts of that kind and I don't think he ever did have but the one wife.</answer>

  <questionnumber>276</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you know Sarah Lawrence?</question>
  <answer>I don't recollect the names at all. If I knew them I don't recollect these names now, and that was a very long time ago you know for a person to remember the names of people that he was not very well acquainted with, if he was acquainted with them at all, and I don't say that I ever knew these people for I don't remember them at all now if I did.</answer>

    </pagenumber>voo, President Brigham Young called the audience to order, and arranged the several quorums according to their standing and the rules of the church. The meeting had been previously called, as stated, to choose a guardian or trustee for said church. Elder Phelps opened the meeting by prayer, and President Young then proceeded to speak, and gave his views of the present situation of the church, now that the prophet and patriarch were taken from our midst by the wickedness of our enemies. For the first time since he became a member of the church, a servant of God, a messenger to the nations in the nineteenth century; for the first time in the kingdom of God, the Twelve apostles of the Lamb, chosen by revelation in this last dispensation of the gospel for the winding up scene present themselves before the saints to stand in their lot according to appointment. While the prophet lived we all walked by "sight", he is taken from us and we must now walk by "faith". After he had explained matters so satisfactorily that every saint could see that Elijah's mantle had truly fallen upon the Twelve, he asked the saints what they wanted. Do you want a guardian, a prophet, a spokesman, or what do you want? If you want any of these officers signify it be (by?) raising the right hand." Not a hand was raised. He then gave the saints his views of what the Lord wanted. Here are the "Twelve" appointed by the finger of God, who hold the keys of the priesthood, and the authority to set in order and regulate the church in all the world. Here is Elder Amasa Lyman and Elder Sydney Rigdon; they were Counselors to the First Presidency, and they are counselors to the Twelve still; if they keep their places; but if either wish to act as spokesman for the prophet Joseph, he must go behind the veil where Joseph is. He continued his remarks for nearly an hour, opening by the Spirit of God, the eyes, ears and hearts of the saints to the subject before them, and to their duty and the glory of God. Elder Amasa Lyman followed and fully accorded with the views of Elder Young. I have been at the back of the prophet Joseph and I shall be at the back of the "Twelve". There is no need of choosing a guardian or head, the apostles have the power as they had anciently, and this is the power that turns the key and will bear off the kingdom of God in all the world, triumphantly; and I will help them obtain that glory, that eye hath not seen, ear hat not heard, and the heart of man hath not conceived,. His remarks were continued in the full fruition of the spirit that whispers; union is strength and peace is joy. Elder Phelps spoke ext, and continued the same spirit and feeling, having known many of the elders for fourteen years, and had seen them take their lives in their hands, without purse or scrip, in summer and in winter, through good and through evil report, for the salvation of souls and for the benefit of Zion, without the hope of reward, save pleasing God and obeying his commandments, -had seen them harness for war when wicked men sought their lives and endeavored to destroy their wives and children; and at all time they were willing to act by counsel; they will do it now; this lake of faces does not seem so pleasant without indicating good; and the elders who have stood on the right and left of our departed prophet, knowing the power and authority of the priesthood will honor it. Elder Rigdon must know how he obtained his endowment, or what he has; for he has not received all, only a small part. Let him and the whole of Israel rejoice this day, for if they rear that temple and are faithful they shall all been endowed (men and women) as God will, till they 115 themselves and their progenitors, as well as secure their posterity. Fear not concerning a prophet; Joseph held the keys in this world and holds them in the world to come, and counsels for you now. I understand the revelations and know that in them all things are written concerning the Twelve. Elder P. P Pratt said that what had been said, was well said, and went into the merits of the subject with his usual animation. Says he, I know we can all live happy if we deal with honest men; I do not like the practice when any one is sick or in difficulty to run to a doctor or lawyer, run to the very worst men to be cured or helped out of a difficulty. Let me die a natural death and suffer wrong, rather than hire a doctor to kill me, or a lawyer to fleece me and leave me to the beggarly elements of the world. As to merchants, I say nothing of them. You know what I mean. Elder Young again resumed, -I do not ask this audience to take my counsel; act for yourselves; if Elder Rigdon is your choice manifest it; if the Twelve be the men to counsel you to finish the great work laid out by our departed prophet, say so, and do not break your covenant by murmuring hereafter. When the whole subject was properly explained and understood, and Counselor Rigdon refused to have his name voted for a spokesman or guardian, the question was put "all in favor of supporting the Twelve in their calling, (every quorum, man and woman), signify it by the uplifted hand." and the vote was unanimous, no hand being raised in the negative. The next vote was that the Twelve should select and appoint two Bishops to act as trustees for the church, according to law. This vote was unanimous also. Another unanimous vote was passed to use every exertion to forward the building of the temple, and so strengthen the hands of the committee. The revelation relating to tithing was referred to, and the manifestation of every saint seemed to be, we will do as the Lord hath commanded; and the assembly was dismissed with the blessings of the Lord. (The following note to the above appears as a part of the communication or article above set forth.) The Twelve would invite the brethren abroad, in obedience to the commandments of the Lord, to gather at Nauvoo, with their means, to help build up the city, and complete the temple, which is now going forward faster than it has at any time since it commenced. Beware of the speculations about the prophet. Believe no tales on the subject; time will tell who are the friends of Joseph Smith, who laid down his life for his brethren. We have no new commandments, but beseech the brethren to honor and obey the old ones. For where-so-ever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together. More in the next. Brigham Young Pres. of the Twelve. Sep't 2, 1844.

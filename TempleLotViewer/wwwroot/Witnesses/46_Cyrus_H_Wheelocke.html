This revelation, with other evidences that the aforesaid heresies were taught and practiced in the church; determined me to leave the office of first Counsellor to the President of the church in Nauvoo, inasmuch as I dared not to preach or administer such laws.

  <answer>Now I do not wish to testify to anything here that I am not wanted to testify to, for I have no interest in this case at all only to tell the truth about what I know, if there is any authority here to tell me when I am to answer a question I will do so. By the Examinee,</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>44</questionnumber>
  <question>You are to answer the questions, as best you can, that are asked you, but when these gentlemen make an objection wait until they are through, and then go on and answer the questions the same as if no objection had been made at all, you are to pay no attentions at all to objections?</question>
  <answer>I will answer the questions if it is proper for me to do so.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Hall,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>45</questionnumber>
  <question>Go ahead and answer the question? They are putting in their legal objections, and they have a right to do that, but it has nothing to do with your testimony, you will just go ahead and answer the questions the same as if no objection has been made?</question>
  <answer>Now I said a while ago that they were the same, but I did not have an opportunity to explain what I meant. There is a considerable difference. In the revelation, if you will read that through you will see that there is nothing but one grant at a time, it is a sealing power that is called "celestial marriage", or marriage for eternity. That is one part of it. That is held by but one man at a time, the power to grant that is held by but one man at a time, and no man has a right to marry outside of that, in that order. There never was any other power, and never will be according to that revelation unless that power is specially delegated to some other person or persons by that man, whereas John C. Bennett got up a company, a secret combination, the purpose of which was to form a society altogether different to the purpose of that revelation. His system was a scheme some what similar to a public seraglio. It was got up for the purpose of cultivating the baser passions in human nature and these men were sworn not to reveal their system, and it was given out secretly by Bennett that Joseph Smith had told him he could get up such a society or system, and finally it came to Joseph's ears, and Bennett was excommunicated with all of his adherents in consequence of it. He confessed to my knowledge the guilt of his adultery, so as not to be cut off from the church, but after he was cut off from the church he wrote a book, which I never read, but in that book I understand he stated that he did practice it but did so by authority of Joseph Smith. The fact is he was cut off for his baseness.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiffs objects to the answer of the witness and moves the court to exclude it from the record for the reason that it is irrelevant and immaterial, and hearsay.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>46</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you what you understood these parties were denying that gave these certificates which you have read here?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason it is irrelevant and immaterial, and calls for an opinion of the witness merely.</mono>
  <answer>Well sir I understand it to be that they condemned utterly John C. Bennett's system, or any other outside of that revelation, and in that covenant entered into by any other authority outside of that revealed in the law of celestial marriage, they utterly repudiated anything else.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>47</questionnumber>
  <question>What position did you occupy there in the church before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, in what</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is leading, incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial.</mono>
  <answer>In the last four months of Joseph's life time, I was detained by him and his brother from a mission that I was appointed to, and there was a conspiracy being organized or hatched at different places, - a conspiracy as we supposed for they detected it from Missouri, leading right into his own house, and they were about to sell him, as he got information of the mob that was being organized to get him. That was one thing, and I was detained to assist them in defeating its operations. Now these men, his counsellors, the affidavit of whom I have read apostatised, and was supposed to be in league with them, and I was asked to remain and trace out as much of the conspiracy as I could.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>49</questionnumber>
  <question>You were detained to do what?</question>
  <answer>To watch and find out what I could, and defend him from his enemies there in Nauvoo, and out side. That was my business and I was with him all the time up to within an hour of his murder.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness, and moves the court to strike it from the record on the ground that it is incompetent and irrelevant and not responsive to any question asked.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>50</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state in what other respect you acted as a guard for Joseph Smith?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and leading.</mono>
  <answer>Well sir there were people there who were accused of being spies, or as acting as spies on Joseph Smith while they visited him. It was said that they were some of his plural wives that he had. His son was accused of being on the watch also, but I don't know what for I never traced him to the house or detected him in anything of the kind, but I was authorized to keep my eye on him, and on these people which I did to the best of my ability.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness for reasons given in the objection to the question to which it is an answer, and on the ground that it is hearsay, and moves the court to strike it from the record for these reasons.</mono>

  <answer>It reads, - "Nauvoo, March 15th 1844. To the brethern of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, living on China Creek, in Hancock County, greeting; - Whereas brother Richard Hewitt has called on me to day, to know my views concerning some doctrines that are preached in your place, and states to me that some of your elders say, that a man having a certain priesthood, may have as many wives as he please and that doctrine is taught here; I say unto you that that man teaches false doctrine, for there is no such doctrine taught here; neither is there any such thing practiced here. Any man found teaching privately or publicly any such doctrine is culpable, and will standochance and membership also; therefore he had better beware what he is about. And again I say unto you, an elder has no business to undertake to preach mysteries in any part of the world, for God has commanded us all to preach nothing but the first principles unto the world. Neither has any elder any authority to preach any mysterious thing to any branch of the church, unless he has a direct commandment from God to do so. Let the matter of the grand councils of heaven and the making of gods, worlds and devils entirely alone; for you are not called to teach any such doctrine, - for neither you, nor the people are capacitated to understand any such principles, - less so to teach them. For when God commands men to teach such principles the saints will receive them. Therefore beware what you teach, for the mysteries of God are not given to all men, and unto those to whom they are given they are placed under restrictions, to impart only such as God will command them; and the residue is to be kept in a faithful breast, otherwise he will be brought under condemnation. By this God will prove his faithful servants, who will be called and numbered with the chosen. And as to the celestial glory, all will enter in and possess that kingdom that obey the gospel, and continue in faith in the Lord unto the end of his days. Now, therefore, I say unto you, you must cease preaching your miraculous things, and let the mysteries alone until by and bye. Preach faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentence and baptism for the remission of sins; the laying on of the hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost; teaching the necessity of strict obedience unto these principles; reasoning out of the scriptures; proving them into the people. Cease your schisms and divisions, and your contentions. Humble yourselves as in dust and ashes, lest God should make you an ensample of is wrath unto the surrounding world. Amen. In the bonds of the everlasting covenant I am your obedient servant. Hyrum Smith".</answer>

  <question>Have you read the whole of the letter?</question>
  <answer>I have</answer>

  <question>Did you ever read that letter in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>70</questionnumber>
  <question>You did?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>71</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you read that letter in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>I read it in the paper as it was published.</answer>

  <answer>It was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>73</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state the differences between a man having as many wives as he pleased, and the principle of plural marriage as taught by Joseph Smith?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that the witness is not competent to testify on the question asked him, and because it calls for an opinion of the witness, and is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial.</mono>
  <answer>Well sir I never knew that any man had a right to any more than one wife, or even that in that covenant, unless it was given him of God, that that man could do so appointed through Joseph Smith. That was the only thing that was taught me, and the only thing I ever heard of. No man had any authority or right to teach any other system of marriage connected with the system of celestial marriage or plural or eternal marriage, - nothing only what appears there, - and with reference to the men that were entitled to them, - that is to plural wives there was no priesthood about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>74</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you if there was any doctrine taught there in Nauvoo that a man could have as many wives as he pleased?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, leading and calls for heresay testimony.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>75</questionnumber>
  <question>You may answer the question? Any doctrine to that effect taught by proper authority?</question>
  <answer>What do you mean by proper authority?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>76</questionnumber>
  <question>Well perhaps I should not have said that, - , - by any authority I will say, - in reference to whether a man could have as man wives as he pleased?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is irrelevant, incompetent, and immeterial, and leading.</mono>
  <answer>Well there was John C. Bennett's system in the geginning I believe. That was a plural wife system, and they had a certain creed and order of priesthood, and they said they could have as many wives as they wanted. They is they said or claimed that certain men could have, but there was no authority in the church for the practice or connected with it in any manner. Nothing that was given out to the world or anything pertaining to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state then if it was the truth, - if the statement made in this letter which you have just read, - the the effect that there was no such a system taught there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that is the truth for there was nothing of the kind taught there at Nauvoo at that time by authority. It was not endorsed by the church or by any member of the church in good standing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>78</questionnumber>
  <question>Then explain if you can, the system of plural marriage as taught you by Joseph Smith?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial and hearsay, and assuming a fact that is not in the record.</mono>
  <answer>
    Yes sir it is taught to me by Joseph Smith, I can tell you that for that is something I know of my own knowledge. I did not

    </pagenumber>see that revelation at that time, but I saw it afterwards after we came here and before it was printed in the book of Doctrine and Covenants.. I heard it at that time in Nauvoo, - I mean for the clerk of Joseph Smith by his request read that revelation on the celestial order of marriage in its entirety, and that was the doctrine contained in it. I don't think it needs any explaining for it will explain itself.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>79</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when did you hear that read? That is something that I did not quite understand?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons above set forth, and on the further ground that it is a cross examination by defendant of its own witness.</mono>
  <answer>I couldn't give you any date at all. I remember once, - I think it was the first time, and it was at Nobles, and another time there was a few of us in the woods, getting out of the way and we were talking together, and I heard about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>80</questionnumber>
  <question>You were out in the woods you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir, and I can make it clear to you in a little while that Joseph had to be on the run to keep out of the way of his enemies, and some times he would go out in the country to one of our neighbors, for he felt that he could trust any one that lived in the woods or forest down the river, and we would go out in the timber to talk under the trees about the principles of the church, amongst other principles that of baptism for the dead was discussed and the building of the temple and all these things together. It was at this time amongst others that he taught us the principle of plural marriage, but his teaching was not specially directed to me, but to all who were in the company. We talked about it as we might here or any brother qualified and having authority to do so will discuss principles when he gets along with his brethern in friendly and confidential discourse.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not the best evidence, and not responsive to the question.</mono>
  <answer>Of course sir I have no desire to testify here at all if I am not wanted to do so. If it is un-necessary I do not desire to speak here at all, for it is nothing to me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>81</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you read the revelation as published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants of the Utah Church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I have.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>82</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state what difference there is, if any, between the revelation as published by the Utah church, and the revelation you heard read?</question>
  <answer>There is no difference whatever in the reading that I can now discover. I do not know of any difference and I will say this that I never heard the thing questioned until now. I don't think I ever heard it questioned until now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>83</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state whether you heard that revelation read before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the questions asked the witness on the ground that it is immeterial and leading.</mono>

  <questionnumber>85</questionnumber>
  <question>And you say that the revelation that you heard read before the death of Joseph Smith, and the revelation as such published by the church here in Utah are identically the same?</question>
  <answer>I can't recollect of any deviation at all. I can't remember that there was any difference but as to swearing that they are identically the same I could not do it, for that would be impossible, but I can swear that to the best of my recollection they were the same identically. Of course I don't think I had that manuscript in my hand or read it for myself, but I heard it read, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>86</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the revelation on plural marriage?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness as immeterial and leading and the answer of the witness as hearsay, and moves the court to exclude it form the record for that reason.</mono>

  <question>You will not swear that he was not the clerk?</question>
  <answer>I will swear that I do not think he was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>103</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he not the clerk of Joseph Smith up to 1844?</question>
  <answer>Some times he was, and some times William Clayton was, and some times it was Thompson.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>104</questionnumber>
  <question>William Clayton was not the clerk up to 1844 at the time of the prophets death was he?</question>
  <answer>I think he was part of the time. I think he acted occasionally up to that time, and there was a man named Thompson that acted a part of the time as his clerk also. I don't know particularly who it was that read that revelation at that time, but I know that it was not either of them, - it was a man who I was not much acquainted with, - I remember that very well. He was the new clerk that was acting at that time.</answer>

  <question>Why did you not say he was there, when you gave a list of the names of the parties that were there?</question>
  <answer>I think I said he was there. If I am not very greatly mistaken I said he was there. I said his name in the first place and I did not think it was necessary to repeat it half a dozen times, for it was understood all the time that he was there.</answer>

  <questionnumber>140</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did Joseph Smith teach you polygamy that day?</question>
  <answer>He did not teach it to me no day, - any more than what I have told you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>141</questionnumber>
  <question>Then he did not teach you polygamy?</question>
  <answer>No sir not in that way. He had that revelation read to us, but he did not teach it to me formally any more than what I have told you. He did not speak to me specially and formally on the subject at all. What he said was to all of us and not to any one in particular.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>142</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever hear him teach it publicly to any one at any time?</question>
  <answer>No sir no more than what I have said, - to three or four or five together at a time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>143</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever hear him teach it from the stand?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>144</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever hear any elder of the church preach it publicly from the stand in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>145</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you hear that?</question>
  <answer>I can't give you the date.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>146</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>No sir it was right away after his death. Will you permit me to tell you who it was?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>147</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well it was William Smith, and he was an apostle in the church before he was expelled or dis-fellowshipped, and I heard him preach it publicly from the stand there in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>148</questionnumber>
  <question>What time was it that he preached it?</question>
  <answer>That very year after Joseph's death in 1844.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>149</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you say that he preached it publicly from the stand in Nauvoo at that time?</question>
  <answer>I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>150</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did he say?</question>
  <answer>A great many things. For instance he undertook to prove that it was right and that that order of marriage would be restored, and he preached so many strange things there to the people that elder John Taylor got up and correct him, and I was a witness there to the whole proceeding myself. This is not hearsay but something that I witnessed myself. John Taylor said that he had no authority to preach or teach any such a thing, even if it was true, and said that it was unjust to his brother and injuring him. Now that is what I heard, and William Smith is the only man I ever heard preach it publicly in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>151</questionnumber>
  <question>Then William Smith was telling the truth about it and John Taylor stopped him? Is that what you say?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for he told more than the truth. He said it was the right of a man to have more wives than one when it was not the right, for it was forbidden.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>152</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it was forbidden?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, except here, - except they were given by a man having authority to do it, or under his authority. Now it was for that that he was cut off from the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>153</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was cut off from the church?</question>
  <answer>William Smith was cut off from the church for that, - I know that. 154 (Mistakenly listed as number 164)</answer>
  <question>What year was that?</question>
  <answer>It was that winter.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>155</questionnumber>
  <question>The winter of 1844?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and do you want me to tell you the particulars?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>156</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, was he cut off the winter of 1844?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know just the season of the year it was, but it was about that time, and I think it was that winter. He was a bad man, and he went and disgraced a woman that lives in this town to day, and I can tell you who it is. I can tell you a good many thing about his business perhaps that you don't want to know if I like to do so.</answer>

  <questionnumber>187</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it not the doctrine of the church, - did you not know what the law of the church was on the subject at that time, - that is at the time you joined the church?</question>
  <answer>About having wives?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>188</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>I never heard anything about it at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>189</questionnumber>
  <question>You had not heard anything about it at all?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>190</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not know the section on marriage that was in the book of Doctrine and Covenants at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>191</questionnumber>
  <question>You did?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>192</questionnumber>
  <question>Does that permit a man to have more wives than one?</question>
  <answer>Well there was no practice of that kind then that I knew anything of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>193</questionnumber>
  <question>Will you answer my question?</question>
  <answer>I have tried to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>194</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you have not suceeded very well in your effort?</question>
  <answer>What is the question?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>195</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you knew at that time that the law on marriage was as printed in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>196</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I ask you if it is not a fact that that did not permit a man to have more than one wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Every man can read that for himself. It says that one man shall have but one wife, and one woman shall have but one husband. That is what it says and you can interpret it for yourself as you please. That is what it said, and I do not wish to pervert the language at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>197</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you think when you joined the church that you would be permitted to have more wives than one?</question>
  <answer>I did not know anything about it at all. They preached the doctrine of the church to me, and I accepted it, and there was nothing said about it at that time. Of course I understood the laws of the church at that time to be the laws laid down in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, but I understood there might be additions made to it as the Lord would see fit to reveal himself to his church through the prophet.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>198</questionnumber>
  <question>Let me refresh your recollection, and see if you recollect this as being the book of Doctrine and Covenants when you joined the church in 1839. I will read paragraph four of section one hundred and one on page two hundred and fifty one of Exhibit "E". It is as follows, - "All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is baptized in to this church, should be held sacred and fulfilled. Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy; we declare that we believe that one man should have one one; and one woman but one husband except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again. It is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will of her husband, neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband. All children are bound by law to obey their parents; and to influence them to embrace any religious faith, or be baptized, or leave their parents without their consent is unlawful and unjust. We believe all persons who exercise controll over their fellow beings and prevent them from embracing the truth will have to answer for that sin". I have read the whole paragraph to you, and now I will ask you if that was the law at the time you became a member of the church in 1839?</question>
  <answer>I don't know a thing about it at all only as I read it there, and anything I say would be merely my opinion, and I do not wish to put an interpretation on that matter at all but leave it just as I find it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>199</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I have read it just as it reads here?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>200</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you say that teaches polygamy?</question>
  <answer>I do not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>201</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the law of the church says that one man shall have but one wife, and one woman but one husband, when you joined the church?</question>
  <answer>That was the way I understood it. |</answer>

  <questionnumber>202</questionnumber>
  <question>And you were never taught any other law than that by Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>I have been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>203</questionnumber>
  <question>You were?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>204</questionnumber>
  <question>When?</question>
  <answer>It was taught in his presence.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>205</questionnumber>
  <question>How was it taught?</question>
  <answer>Well the revelation on celestial marriage that came after that was taught in his presence.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>206</questionnumber>
  <question>The revelation on celestial marriage permitted a man to be sealed to his wife that was living, and to his wife that was dead, did it not, and was that not all there was to it?</question>
  <answer>yes sir it was that, and it was more for it was as it is taught in the revelation here concerning celestial marriage, that a mans wife was under certain conditions. -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>207</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was not this it, - "it is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will of her husband"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I admit that, for I know it is there some where.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>208</questionnumber>
  <question>Now what was the first date that you saw that publication of that revelation on polygamy?</question>
  <answer>I don't know sir, and I don't know that I ever took note of it either.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>209</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see it before it was printed in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>210</questionnumber>
  <question>You never saw it before it was printed there?</question>
  <answer>I told you that I did not see it. I saw what purported to be that manuscript but I did not read it or see what was written.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>211</questionnumber>
  <question>How did you see it?</question>
  <answer>I saw it in the hands of the clerk that read it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>212</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you willing to swear that the revelation that is printed in this book of Doctrine and Covenants (the book published by the church in Utah) is the identical paper that was read to you in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I did not say it was in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>213</questionnumber>
  <question>Well where was it you heard it read?</question>
  <answer>It was in Montrose.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>214</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you could not do that, could you?</question>
  <answer>Do what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>215</questionnumber>
  <question>Say the revelation or alleged revelation that you board read at Montrose was the same as the one printed in this book here?</question>
  <answer>I told you in the beginning I could not say it was the same, but I believe it is the same for it is said to be the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>216</questionnumber>
  <question>Who said it was the revelation?</question>
  <answer>The clerk that read it. He said that, and it was sanctioned by the President of the church there at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>217</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he say it was a revelation on sealing, or a revelation on celestial marriage, or a revelation on plural marriage?</question>
  <answer>I said it was called a revelation on celestial marriage, and it was taught as it is in there. Is sounded just like that that is printed in there. There is no difference that I can see and I believe them to be the same.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>218</questionnumber>
  <question>How many pages of manuscripts is there, or was there in the manuscript?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember anything about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>219</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was there twenty?</question>
  <answer>I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>220</questionnumber>
  <question>Well have you any recollection on that subject?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say. I did not pay any attention to it in that way at the time, for I did not feel the importance of counting the pages at the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>221</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was the clerk's name that read it?</question>
  <answer>
    I don't know. I told you in the beginning that I did not know, and I did not. I don't think I ever did know his name. He was a man that was a stranger to me, and he came there with the prophet I think and was

    </pagenumber>called on to read it and did read it, but I don't know what his name was. I don't think that I had ever seen him before that time or after that time either for that matter.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>222</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that revelation that was read to you there, for sealing for eternity?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>223</questionnumber>
  <question>And it provided that when a man had been married, and his wife died, he was permitted to take another wife?</question>
  <answer>It did not say anything about that, that I know of, only as it is written in there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>224</questionnumber>
  <question>Written where?</question>
  <answer>In the book there, - that is as near as I can remember what it said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>225</questionnumber>
  <question>Well state how that is written in there?</question>
  <answer>I will tell you if you will give me time to explain what I mean to you.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>226</questionnumber>
  <question>Well never mind your explanations. If these gentlemen want your explanations they can call for them at the proper time, but I want you to state how it is written in the book here, if you can?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't do it, but I am ready to read it to you if you want me to do it. I can't remember all that is in it only in a general way, but I can read it to you if you desire me to do so, and then you can see for yourself what is in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>227</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you cannot tell what is in it without reading it, or hearing it read?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for I never committed it to memory sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>228</questionnumber>
  <question>It might be changed from the way it was when it was read to you by this man, whose name you do not know, - might it not be changed from the way it was when it was read to you on that occasion, and you not know it?</question>
  <answer>What do you mean, - in what way?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>229</questionnumber>
  <question>I mean that in the printing of this, it might have been changed from the way it was when it was read to you in Illinois, and you would not be able to know or detect the change?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say for I never saw the inside of the manuscript, but I say to the best of my knowledge and recollection from hearing it read, - that is the hearing of the document read, and this one here, that there is no change or difference in them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>230</questionnumber>
  <question>Now did not the document that you read consist of only one page of manuscript?</question>
  <answer>I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>231</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is your best recollection as to that?</question>
  <answer>I don't know how many pages there was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>232</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there more than one page?</question>
  <answer>I think so, but I can't say postively.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>233</questionnumber>
  <question>Was not the document on celestial marriage only?</question>
  <answer>Well I say I don't know what all was in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>234</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is this not what you recollect that was taught in that document that you head red, - that a man could be sealed to his wife that was living, and to his wife that had died?</question>
  <answer>Well of course. Afterward he told me that that was proper.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>235</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was all he did teach you?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>236</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that not all he did teach you?</question>
  <answer>No sir it was not all he taught me by a good deal.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>237</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what else did he tell you?</question>
  <answer>Well sir he told me a good deal that is not competent to this case, and that has nothing to do with this case.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>238</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your judgement?</question>
  <answer>
    Yes sir that is my final judgement that it would not be for your benefit or the benefit of any gentlemen here. I will answer any question you ask me as best I can, but that is not competent to this case at all, for I certainly shall not undertake to tell you all that Joseph Smith disclosed

    </pagenumber>to me about the doctrines of the church.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>239</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I have not asked you to do that?</question>
  <answer>Well you have come pretty near to asking me that, and in my judgement and recollection I have told you repeatedly all that I care to tell you about it, and there is no use of questioning me any further sire.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>240</questionnumber>
  <question>Well never mind sir. When I want advice as to what questions I shall ask you I shall probably go else where for advice, and I want you to understand that there is no use getting excited over the matter, for I propose to ask you just what questions I deem proper to ask you, and I propose also that you shall answer them, or we shall see what can be done towards making you do so. Now you said that these certificates that you read from the Times & Seasons here, that were signed by these parties, only referred to the Bennett doctrine?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>241</questionnumber>
  <question>I understood you to say that the certificates you read here today from the Times & Seasons signed by these different parties man and women, members of the church here at Nauvoo, - only referred to the doctrines taught by John C. Bennett?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that is the way I understood it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>242</questionnumber>
  <question>It did not refer to plural marriage or anything of that kind under that revelation?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not so understand it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>243</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now let me read this to you?</question>
  <answer>I don't know but they had, -what was authorized there, but that Bennett business I know was the occasion of it. There was a man teaching that doctrine there and they denounced it as I understand it, assuming that he did, it was untimely, for they were not permitted to publicly teach these things, and who ever did was subject to lose their fellowship, -I know that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>244</questionnumber>
  <question>Were they permitted to teach it privately?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know any body that had a right to do that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>245</questionnumber>
  <question>There was not anybody, -was not any body that pretended to teach it either publicly or privately liable to excommunication?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir unless it was done under certain conditions. They were liable to be excommunicated or disfellowshipped unless they had the authority to do it from the ma that held the keys of that priesthood. I know if I had taught it I would be liable to be excommunicated mighty quick.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>246</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now I will read this, -"We the undersigned members of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and residents of the City of Nauvoo, persons of families, do hereby certify and declare that we know of no other rule or system of marriage, than the one published from the book of Doctrine and Covenant and we give this certificate to show that Dr. J. C. Bennett's secret wife system is a creature of his own sake, as we know of no such society in this place, nor never did". You recognize that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>247</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there a plurality of wives revelation in that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, Now do you want me to answer that as it is?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>248</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>I believe what is stated there is the truth, for there was no other system of marriage at that time but what was in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, for this was not called a system of marriage, for it was sealing, - it was not the same ceremony at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>249</questionnumber>
  <question>You recollect reading the law of the church on marriage that was published in the same paper that this certificate was in?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I knew what the law on marriage was as it was published.</answer>

  <questionnumber>250</questionnumber>
  <question>Published in what?</question>
  <answer>In the book of Doctrine and Covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>251</questionnumber>
  <question>Well it was printed in the same paper, and on the same page was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and it was not pertaining to the original covenant, nor the ceremony.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>252</questionnumber>
  <question>And we give this certificate to show that Dr. J.C. Bennett's secret wife system is a creature of his on make, as we know of no such society in this place, nor never did. What do you say to that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is true I guess. I don't think that is anything wrong with that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>253</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was there a different system of marriage from that in the Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>Only certain men were permitted to take wives, and if they were worthy were sealed to them for time and eternity. That was the way it was, but that had nothing to do with what is stated in this certificate that I can see.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>254</questionnumber>
  <question>It was not in marriage at all then?</question>
  <answer>It was in celestial marriage. That is what it is called.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>255</questionnumber>
  <question>If it was celestial marriage it did not refer to this world at all did it?</question>
  <answer>Well I think that the ceremony would say that they were sealed for time and eternity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>256</questionnumber>
  <question>You know that was the ceremony, these words, "seal you for time and eternity"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>257</questionnumber>
  <question>And you know that was in the ceremony, these words, "seal you for time and eternity"?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>258</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you hear it performed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>259</questionnumber>
  <question>You have heard the ceremony performed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I have heard the ceremony performed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>260</questionnumber>
  <question>You have heard it performed there in Nauvoo before Joseph Smith died?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>261</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you did not here that ceremony performed before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>262</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I want to read you another one of these certificates, "We the undersigned members of the ladies of the relief society, and married females do certify and declare that we know of no system of marriage being practiced in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, save the one contained in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and we give this certificate to the public to show that J.C. Bennett's secret wife system is a disclosure of his own make". You recollect that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>262</questionnumber>
  <question>Have I read that correctly?</question>
  <answer>I see nothing wrong about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>263</questionnumber>
  <question>That says that there was no other system of marriage practiced save the one taught in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>264</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was there any other practiced?</question>
  <answer>I don't know of any excepting one man who had the right to practice it, and giving other men the right to do so, that is giving other men wives if they were competent to receive them. Now I don't know of any other only that in the church, excepting where a man wanted to be married by a magistrate or a minister.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>265</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you say there was no other system taught as the doctrine of the church or practiced as the doctrine of the church excepting that taught in the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>I don't know of any other only this revelation, that was all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>266</questionnumber>
  <question>You never say the revelation to read it yourself, did you?</question>
  <answer>I have told you that three times at least I believe. I have told you that I did not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>267</questionnumber>
  <question>You have?</question>
  <answer>
    Yes sir, I have and I am ready and willing and anxious to answer any questions you may ask me, but I

    </pagenumber>must decline to answer that question any more.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>268</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you hear Joseph Smith denounce the John C. Bennett secret wife system from the stand in Nauvoo, in a public sermon?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>269</questionnumber>
  <question>That was in 1844 was it not?</question>

  <question>Don't you know that he and Hyrum Smith cut a man off from the church for teaching polygamy?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>271</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is was published in the church paper?</question>
  <answer>I don't know. It seems to me that I heard something about it, but I don't remember how it was. I haven't the slightest doubt but that they did for it seems to me that I remember something about that, but I can't recollect just how it was.</answer>

  <question>Did not Joseph Smith in 1844 when he was denouncing the John C. Bennett secret wife system, then publicly declare that there was not any such a system or doctrine in the church?</question>
  <answer>What system?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>273</questionnumber>
  <question>As that of a man having more than one wife at the same time?</question>
  <answer>I do not recollect. If he said that I don't think I heard it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>274</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did he say about it?</question>
  <answer>He said that there was no such a system as that introduced or practiced by John C. Bennett. He said it was hell, and you would take people that practiced it to hell. He said that and a good many other things that I cannot now recollect. I don't remember just all that he did say about it.</answer>

  <question>You identified this book as the Times & Seasons did you not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>276</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I want to read from page seven hundred and fifteen for the purpose of refreshing your recollection. This is an article published the 15th of November 1844, and it reads thus, - "The saints of the last days have witnessed the out going and the incomings of so many apostates, that nothing but truth has any effect on them. In the present instance after the sham quotations of Sidney and his clique, from the Bible, Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants, to skulk off under the dreadful splendor of spiritual wifery, which is brought into the account as graciously as if the law of the land allowed a man a plurality of wives, is fiendish, and like the rest of Sidney's revelation just because he wanted to go to Pittsburg and live. Woe to the man or men who will thus willfully lie to injure an innocent people. The law of the land and the rules of the church do not allow one man to have more than one wife alive at once, but if any mans wife die he has a right to marry another, and to be sealed to both for eternity; to the living and the dead. There is no law of God or man against it. This is all the spiritual wife system that ever was tolerated in the church, and they know it." Now do you recollect reading that when it was published?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>277</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the law of the church then was it not?</question>
  <answer>Well that says so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>278</questionnumber>
  <question>And that was what was taught, was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - I don't know what was taught secretly, but I know if I had taught anything else I should have been cut off from the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>279</questionnumber>
  <question>And you would have been cut off because the church did not accept any other doctrine?</question>
  <answer>
    As a church it had not, because it had not gone to the church at the time, but it was revealed to certain men in the church with the assurance that it would in the

  <answer>No sir, I don't know how far they had adopted it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>281</questionnumber>
  <question>Well had they adopted it as a church, - had the church as a church adopted it?</question>
  <answer>I don't know what portion of it had been adopted by the church, or what portion or branch of he church had adopted it.</answer>

  <question>Do you know that they had adopted it at that time?</question>
  <answer>I don't know, but some of them had.</answer>

  <question>Well do you know that they had as a body adopted it?</question>
  <answer>I don't know as they had individually, for I never polled them.</answer>

  <question>Well now I want to read you what John Taylor had to say about it at that time, and he was one of the Twelve, was he not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>291</questionnumber>
  <question>He was the editor of the Times & Seasons on the 15th day of November 1844, - in the date of the issue in which was published the extract which I have last read to you, signed by an "old man of Israel", says in referring editorially to that communication, - "For the communication of an old man of Israel, and the letter of Elder Addison Pratt from the islands of the Pacific Ocean, we be-speak a hearty welcome. They are genuine. Now what do you say to that?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reason "that there is no evidence to show that John Taylor ever wrote such an editorial comment as has been read to the witness".</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>292</questionnumber>
  <question>John Taylor was the editor of the Times & Seasons, wasn't he Mr Witness?</question>
  <answer>I don't know whether he was or not. I know that he was its editor at one time, but I can't say whether he was or not. I know that he was its editor at one time, but I can't say whether he was or not at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>293</questionnumber>
  <question>Well will you read this from issue of November 15th 1844, and tell me from that who was the editor of the Times & Seasons on that date, - it is found on the last page of the issue of that date?</question>
  <answer>"The Times & Seasons is published about the first and fifteenth of every month, on the corner of Water and Bain Streets, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois, by John Taylor, editor and proprietor. Terms, - two dollars per annum payable in all cases in advance. Any person procuring five new subscribers, and forwarding us ten dollars current money, will received one volume gratis. All letters must be addressed to John Taylor, editor, postpaid, or they will not receive attention."</answer>
  <answer>That is correct. I haven't any doubt about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>294</questionnumber>
  <question>About what?</question>
  <answer>But that he was the editor as it is stated there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>295</questionnumber>
  <question>He was one of the apostles at that time, wasn't he?</question>
  <answer>Well yes sir he was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>296</questionnumber>
  <question>Then it is a fact that there was no such a doctrine as the plural wife doctrine accepted by the church at that time?</question>
  <answer>I did not so state. It was not taught or practiced openly. It was not taught or generally preached that I know anything about.</answer>

  <answer>I don't know about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>298</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is your best recollection about that?</question>
  <answer>Well I say it had not that I know anything about?</answer>

  <question>Not at that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>300</questionnumber>
  <question>You know it has been since that time, don't you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>301</questionnumber>
  <question>When?</question>
  <answer>Well the first time that I received authority to teach in publicly was in 1852 I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>302</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the first time you received authority to teach it publicly?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I would not be postive as to the date, but I think that was when it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>303</questionnumber>
  <question>And you have been teaching ever since?</question>
  <answer>Well most of the time, I taught it until the law forbid it and then I stopped. I did until it was pronounced to be unlawful by the United States Supreme Court, and then I stopped it, and afterwards in common with the rest of the church in conference assembled we adopted the manifesto of President Woodruf.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>304</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now the recelation on plural marriage was the law of God was it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, to a certain extent.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>305</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you not regard it as such, and teach it as the law of God?</question>
  <answer>No I did not teach it as the law of God any further than I taught it as a revelation from God, that was to be applied when it was proper and there was a man prepared to receive it from a proper authority. I never saw the man in my life that I thought it was proper to go and get him a wife, or engage in it in that way. Never. I have taught men that I believe in it, and showed them my reasons for believing in it but I have not taught men that they were under obligations to practice it at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>306</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you did not have very much faith in its truth?</question>
  <answer>I did believe it to be just as it was written and given to Joseph Smith. There is no doubt sir in my mind but that it was just what it purported to be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>307</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, but this revelation itself teaches that a man cannot be exalted in the celestial kingdom unless he has more wives than one?</question>
  <answer>No sir it does not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>308</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you undertake to say that it does not teach that?</question>
  <answer>I do, - not in that language.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>309</questionnumber>
  <question>Well don't it in substance teach that?</question>
  <answer>No sir not exactly that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>310</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what does it teach if it is not that, - what does it teach but that?</question>
  <answer>Well I told you I could not remember just what was in it, but if you do not know I will read it to you section by section and you can see just what is in it for yourself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>311</questionnumber>
  <question>Well sir I don't care about you reading it section by section or any other way. You have testified here that the revelation that you say was given to Joseph Smith, and which you heard read down in Iowa some place at a place called Montrose was the same as the alleged revelation published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants here, and to do that you must know what was in both of them. I asked you if the revelation published by the church here did not teach that a man in order to be exalted must have more wives than one, and you say it does not teach that, and I ask you now what it does teach if it does not teach that?</question>

  <questionnumber>312</questionnumber>
  <question>I will get you to look at section 132 of defendants Exhibit "A" and I will ask you if that was or is the revelation on plural marriage that was adopted by the church of which Brigham Young was the President here in Salt Lake in 1852?</question>
  <answer>Let me hear your question again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>313</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if section 132 in defendants Exhibit "A", was the revelation or alleged revelation that was adopted by the church here in Utah of which Brigham Young was the President in 1852?, - is that the revelation on plural marriage that was adopted at that time?</question>
  <answer>Well I was not here. I was not here at the time, and I received a letter in England for I was in England at the time, but I have no doubt but that is the one that was received by the church. It was in the church before that time and was practiced before that, but it had not been formally accepted by the church, and that was the first permission that the elders had to preach or announce that doctrine publicly. I know I was in England when I received authority to do that, - that is to publicly announce the principle, and I suppose it was right away after action had been taken on it by the church here that I received permission to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>314</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is that the revelation that you were permitted to preach for the first time in 1852?</question>
  <answer>Well I never did preach it before that time at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>315</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is that the revelation, - this section 132?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that is the revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>316</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is the revelation you were permitted to preach after that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. After 1852 I think it was, I don't know that there was anything particular about it, but was after that permitted to make known generally and publicly the contents of the revelation, - that is publicly to the church you know in my travels to the various branches of the church with which I came in contact. Of course I had known of this thing before, - for years before, but of course I had not been permitted to preach it or teach it to the church until that time when formal permission was given me to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>317</questionnumber>
  <question>Why did you not preach it or teach it before that time?</question>
  <answer>Simply because we were not authorized to do so in England or any where else, until formal permission had been given us to do so, and if we had done we would have been cut off from the church for doing it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>318</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you say that you received notice of its adoption by the church, and permission to preach it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>319</questionnumber>
  <question>How long before that time had it been adopted by the church?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>320</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know how long before that time it had been published to the church?</question>
  <answer>I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>321</questionnumber>
  <question>Has it ever been published before 1852?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that it had been. It might have been but I don't think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>322</questionnumber>
  <question>Had it been published in any book?</question>

  <question>Let the whole of this go in as a part of the cross examination of this witness?</question>
  <answer>Excuse me if I said I would and could read that section by section and explain it as I went along for I could not undertake to do that, but I will read it for you gladly and answer any question the very best that I can, which you may ask me as I go along. I will answer any question pertaining to it as we go along if you will ask me the questions, and do the very best I know how.</answer>

  <question>Well I want to incorporate the whole of that section as a part of your cross examination, that is simply a notice to the Examiner to incorporate it in the record.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>
    The following is section 132 of "Def'ts exhibit "A" (the foregoing section referred to, has been copied in the record already twice as a part of the cross-examination of two different witnesses) and is in words and figures as follows, Section 132 Revelation on the eternity of the Marriage Covenant, including plurality of wives. Given through Joseph the Seer, in Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois, July 12th 1843. 1 Verify, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand, to know and understand wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants, as toughing the principles and doctrines of their having many wives and concubines; 2 Behold, and low, I am the Lord they God, and will answer thee as touching this matter; 3 Therefore prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same. 4 For behold, I reveal unto you a new and everlasting covenant, and if ye abide not that covenant, then are you damned for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory. 5 For all who will have a blessing at my hand, shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof as were instituted from before the foundation of the world; 6 And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fullness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof, must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned saith the Lord God. 7 And verily I say unto you, that the doctrines of this law are these; all covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise of him who is anointed, both as well for time and all eternity, and that too most holy by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power, (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph, to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue of force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end, have an end when men are dead.

    </pagenumber>8 Behold, mine house is a house of order saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion. 9 Will I accept of an offering saith the Lord, that is not made in my house. 10 Or will I receive at your hands that which I have not appointed. 11 And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord, except it be my law, even as I and my father ordained unto you before the world was. 12 I am the Lord thy God, and I give unto you this commandment, that no man shall come unto the Father but, by me, or by my word which is law saith the Lord. 13 And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrownes or principalities, or powers, or things of name, what-so-ever they may be, that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in or after the resurrection, saith the Lord our God. 14 For whatsoever things remain, are by me; and what so ever things are not by me shall be shaken and destroyed. 15 Therefore if a man marry him a wife in the world and he marry her not by me, nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world, and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are our of the world; therefore they are not bound by any law when they are our of the world. 16 Therefore when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are re-appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding and an eternal weight of glory. 17 For these angels did not abide my law, therefore they cannot be enlarged, but remain seperately and signly without exaltation in their saved condition to all eternity, and from henceforth are not Gods, but are angels of God for ever and ever. 18 And again, verily I say unto you if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or y my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise through Him whom I have anointed and appointed to this power, - then it is not valid, neither of force when they are our of the world, because they are not joined by me saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are not joined by me saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are our of the world it cannot be received there, because the angels and the Gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot therefore inherit my glory, for my house is a house of order saith the Lord God. 19 And agin, verily I say unto you that if a man marry a wife by any word which is in my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is annointed unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of the priesthood; and it shall be said unto them, ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first reserrection, in the palities and powers, dominions, all geights and depths, - then shall it be written in the Lambs book of Life that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood it shall be done unto them all things what soever my servant hath put upon them, in time and through all eternity, and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels and the Gods which are set there to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds for ever and ever.

    </pagenumber>20 Then shall they be Gods, because they have no end; there for shall they be from everlasting to everlasting because they continue; then shall they be above all, because they have all power, and the angels are subject to them. 21 Verily, verily I say unto you, except you abide my law, ye cannot attain this glory. 22 For straight is the gate and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives, and few there is that find it because ye receive me not in the world, neither do ye know me. 23 But if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation, that where I am there shall ye be also. 24 This is eternal lives, to know the only wise and true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. I am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law. 25 Broad is the gate and wide the way that leadeth to the deaths, and many there are that go in thereat; because they receive me not, neither do they abide in my law. 26 Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she shall commit any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder therein they shed innocent blood, - yet they shall come forth in the first reserrection, and enter into their exaltation; but they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered into the buffetings of Satan unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God. 27 The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the world, nor out of the world, is that ye commit murder, wherein ye shed innocent blood, and assent unto my death, after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that bideth not this law can in no wise enter into my glory, but shall be damned saith the Lord God. 28 I am the Lord they God, and will give unto thee the law of my Holy Priesthood, as was ordained by me, and my Father before the world was. 29 Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received by revelation and commandment by my word, saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation, and sitteth upon his throne. 30 Abraham received promises concerning his seed, and of the fruit of his loins, - from whose loins ye are, namely, my servant, Joseph, - which were to continue so long as they were in the world; and as touching Abraham and his seed, out of the world they should continue; both in the world and out of the world should they continue as innumerable as the stars or if ye were to count the saints upon the seashore ye could not number them. 31 This praise is yours, also, because ye are of Abraham, and the promise was made unto Abraham; and by this law are the continuation of the works of my Father, wherein he glorifieth himself. 32 Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham; enter ye into my law, and ye shall be saved. 33 But if ye enter not into my law ye cannot receive the promise of my Father, which he made unto Abraham. 34 God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to wife. And why did she do it? Because this was the law, and from Hagar sprang many people. This, therefore was fulfilling, among other things, the promises. 35 Was Abraham therefore, under condemnation? Verily, I say unto you, Nay; for I, the Lord, commanded it.

Abraham, however did not refuse, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. 37 Abraham received concubines; and they bear his children and it was accounted unto hi for righteousness, because they were given unto him and he abode in my law, as Isaac also, and Jacob did none other things than that which were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels, but are Gods. 38 David also received many wives and concubines, as also Solomon and Moses, my servants; as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and in nothing did they sin, save in those things which they received not of me. 39 Davids wives and concubines were given unto him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me, save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and receiveth his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another saith the Lord. 40 I am the Lord they God, and I gave unto thee a servant Joseph, as appointment, and restore all things; ask what ye will and it shall be given unto you according to my word; 41 And as ye have asked concerning adultery, - verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the Holy annointing, she hath commited adultery, and shall be destroyed. 42 If she be not in the new and everlasting covenant, and she be with another man, she has commited adultery; 43 And if her husband be with another woman, and he was under a vow, he hath broken his vow, and hath commited adultery. 44 And if she hath not commited adultery, but is innocent and hath not broken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood, to take her, and give her unto him, that hath not committed adultery but hath been faithful; for he shall be made ruler over many; 45 For I have conferred upon you the keys and the power of the Priesthood wherein I restore all things, and make known unto you all things in due time. 46 And verily, verily I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on earth, shall be sealed in Heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth in my name, and by my word saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens; and whatsoever sins you remit on earth shall be remitted eternal in the Heavens; and whosoever sins you retain on earth, shall be retained in Heaven. 47 And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless, I will bless, and whomsoever you cruse, I will curse, saith the Lord; for I, the Lord, am they God. 48 And again verily I say unto you, my servant Joseph, that whatsoever you give on earth, and to whomsoever you give any one on earth, but my word and according to my law, it shall be visited with blessings, and not cursings, and with my power, saith the Lord, and shall be without condemnation on earth and in heaven; 49 For I am the Lord they God, and will be with these men to the end of the world, and through all eternity; verily I seal upon you your exaltation, and prepare a throne for you in the

I have seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which I have told you, go, therefore, and I make a way for your escape, as I accepted the offering of Abraham, of his son Isaac. 51 Verily, I say unto you a commandement I give unto mine hand-maid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you that she stay herself, and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her; for I did it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham and that I might require an offering at your hand, by covenant and sacrifice. 52 And let mine hand-maid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure; and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God. 53 For I am the Lord they God, and ye shall obey my voice; and I give unto my servant Joseph, that he shall be made ruler over many things, and from henceforth, I will strengthen him. 54 And I command mine hand maid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment, she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord they God, and I will destroy her, if she abide not in my law; 55 But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply him, and give unto him an hundred fold in this world, of father, and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lived in the eternal worlds. 56 And again, verily I say, let mine hand maid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord, they God, will bless her and multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice. 57 And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy, for I am the Lord they God, and he is my servant, and behold, and lo, I am with him, as I was with Abraham, they father, even unto his exaltation and glory. 58 Now, as toughing the law of my Priesthood, there are many things pertaining thereto. 59 Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was Aaron, by mine own voice, and by the voice of him who sent me; and I have endowed him with the keys of the power of this Priesthood, if he do anything in my name and according to my law, and by my word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify him. 60 Let no one therefore, set on my servant Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I require at his hands, for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God. 61 And again as pertaining to the law of the Priesthood; If any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent; and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery, for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him, and to no one else. 62 And if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him, therefore is he justified. 63 But if one, or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man; she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed;

  <answer>I don't know what authority did it, but I suppose it was done by proper authority or it would not have been done at all. They took the one out and placed the other I suppose because they knew of they fact that the revelation on celestial marriage has been given by Joseph Smith before his death.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>338</questionnumber>
  <question>And knowing the fact also that one was in contradiction of the other?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't understand it that way. I do not understand the fact to be that they contradict each other. Because there is more in the one than the other. The one is simply more comprehensive than the other, but I do not see that they contradict each other at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>339</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you say that the one is not a contradiction of the other?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't so understand it myself at all. The one is simply an expression of the church more in the nature of a resolution expressing the position of the church, while the other is a revelation which of course has greater authority than the other, but it does not necessarily follow that they are contradictory of each other.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>340</questionnumber>
  <question>Well let me read from section one hundred and one of Exhibit "E" - that is the old book of Doctrine and Covenants published in 1835, - "Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife; and one woman but one husband, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again". What do you say to that?</question>
  <answer>Well that is correct. That was the position of the church at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>341</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now would that not be a contradiction of the revelation on polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Well no sir I will tell you, and I am very glad you asked me about it. I do not acknowledge that polygamy has anything to do with that revelation on receiving celestial marriage, for polygamy is a principle in which both sexes can indulge, - that is to say that polygamy and celestial marriage are entirely different. It is sealing, -</answer>

    </pagenumber>Section one hundred and one of Exhibit "E", offered in evidence in connection with the cross examination of this witness, is in words and figures as follows, Section CI Marriage. 1. According to the customs of all civilized nations, marriage is regulated by laws and ceremonies; therefore we believe that all marriages in this church of Christ of Latter Day Saints, should be solemnized in a public meeting, or feast, prepared for that purpose; and that the solemnization should be performed by a presiding high priest, high priest, bishop, elder or priest, not even prohibiting those persons who are desirous to get married, of being married by other authority. We believe that it is not right to prohibit members of this church from marrying out of the church, if it be their determination so to do, but such persons will be considered weak in the faith of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. 2. Marriage should be celebrated with pray and thanksgiving and at the solemnization, the persons to be married, standing together, the man on the right, and the woman on the left, shall be addressed by the person officiating, as he shall be directed by the Holy Spirit; and if there be no legal objections he shall say, calling each by their names, "You both mutually agree to be each others companion, husband and wife, observing the legal right belonging to this condition that is keeping yourselves wholly for each other, and from all others during your lives". And when they have answered "yes", he shall pronounce them "husband and wife", in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the laws of the country and authority vested in him; "may God add his blessings and keep you to fulfill your covenants from hence forth and forever. Amen". 3. The clerk of every church should keep a record of all marriages, solemnized in his branch. 4. All legal contracts of marriages made before a person is baptized into this church, should be held sacred and fulfilled. In as much as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy; we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again. It is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will of her husband, neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband. All children are bound by law to object their parents; and to influence them to embrace any religious faith, or be baptized, or leave their parents without their consent, is unlawful and unjust. We believe that all persons who exercise control over their fellow beings, and prevent them from embracing the truth, will have to answer for that sin.

  <answer>No sir, no further than I heard there was an endowment of the Spirit at Kirtland. That was in '35 as I understood it, but I had never heard anything about its being practiced in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>142</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the endowment that you heard of being practiced in Kirtland?</question>

  <questionnumber>155</questionnumber>
  <question>Why was that the case?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is irrelevant and immeterial and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>Why simply because no one else had any business there, and they were not permitted to be there. Now that was the rule at the time I received mine at least, but of course I don't know what happened afterwards.</answer>

  <answer>I could not tell you. I only know positively what I saw and experienced myself, and I don't know positively the limitations they put on the administration of that ordinance. I could not tell you how that was for at the time I went to Utah I heard of a good many things being taught and practiced there, but at the time I was in Texas and the Indian Territory, of course I don't know anything about what was going on in Utah.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>183</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am talking now about what was going on in Utah at the time you were there, - at the time that you were endowed?</question>

  <question>In reference to the endowments I mean?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>185</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will repeat my question, - read the question to the witness. The Notary hereupon reads to the witness question number "182", as follows, - "Now in Salt Lake City, was there any such a thing known as the ordinance of the endowment being administered to any one, who had not been joined in matrimony, as husband and wife?</question>

  <answer>It was after we moved there the second time, - after we went back there the second time from Nauvoo.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>202</questionnumber>
  <question>That was where you first heard of polygamy or plurality of wives?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Traber, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>203</questionnumber>
  <question>At what place in Wisconsin was that?</question>
  <answer>Wait a moment and I will tell you, - (witness reflects) it was at Prairie LaCrosse.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>204</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that Wisconsin then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>205</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there an organization there at that time, a church organization?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>206</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the organization?</question>
  <answer>Well Lyman Wight was there with his little band of saints.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>207</questionnumber>
  <question>Lyman Wight was the head of the organization of the church there at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>Did he go from Texas there?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>209</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did he go from to that place?</question>

  <questionnumber>211</questionnumber>
  <question>And his organization went with him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - most of them did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>212</questionnumber>
  <question>Where were you when you first heard of the practice of polygamy at LaCrosse?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know that we were just there. We were on the move at the time. It was in the summer of 1845 and we were on the move for Texas, and Lyman had performed the ceremony we understood afterwards, and had sealed a young lady with us to a man that had another wife. Lyman Wight had just done it a short time before that. I know this is so for at the time I was paying my regards to the young lady myself, and I did not know for some time that she was another mans wife. I did not know that until I found it out afterwards. We were on the move for Texas at the time and when we got down about to Davenport, there was where I came into the possession of the knowledge that she was another mans wife, and of course I dropped her might quick. Now that was the first intimation that I had that there was anything of the kind practiced, - for that was the first case of spiritual marriage that ever came to my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>213</questionnumber>
  <question>Now that you understood to have been a spiritual marriage?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - spiritual wife marriage as it is termed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>214</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now is it a necessary and logical sequence, if they were spiritually married that they would practice polygamy?</question>
  <answer>No sir. They were spiritually united, they said that they were in polygamy, as well as those that were not (???)). The understanding was that they would enjoy the same glory as the others, but the ones that had more wives would enjoy a greater portion of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>215</questionnumber>
  <question>The man that had more than one spirituan wife would enjoy a greater measure of glory than the man would that had only one?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>216</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you mean spiritual, or other wise? Joined Spiritually or other wise?</question>
  <answer>
    They were to enjoy the glory hereafter, - the

    </pagenumber>glory which was in eternity would be greater.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>217</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you mean that would be applicable if they practiced polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>218</questionnumber>
  <question>How do you know that?</question>
  <answer>Well that is what Lyman Wight told us, that is what he taught us.</answer>

  <question>Did he teach in in Texas?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>220</questionnumber>
  <question>Did he practice it there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  <mono>Mr. Southern -"I am not objecting to any of these questions". "They might be objectionable but I am not objecting to any of them you see". The answers suit me too well to do that". By Mr Traber, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>221</questionnumber>
  <question>No, if they were prior, -if they referred to a time prior to 1844 you would".</question>

  <questionnumber>222</questionnumber>
  <question>According to your understanding who was it first taught and practiced polygamy in the Mormon church?</question>
  <answer>Lyman Wight.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "Well now that last answer and the question I must I think object to, -particularly to the question. It calls for an option of the witness. I do not object though particular but I do object to the method of examination." By Mr Traber.-</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>223</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you know Joseph Smith the Seer?</question>

  <question>Well now if polygamy had been taught and practiced in the church at that time in Nauvoo or any where else, would you have been likely to have heard of it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think I would".</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>228</questionnumber>
  <question>Would you have been likely to have heard of it?</question>
  <answer>I think so. Now I have my reasons for thinking so and they are these. My father was one of the first elders in the church, and if he had heard of any such a thing I think I think he would have said something about it and we would all have heard about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>229</questionnumber>
  <question>And you say you did not hear of it, -that is of the teaching or practice of polygamy prior to the death of Joseph the Seer?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  <question>Did you ever know of Joseph the seer teaching, preaching or practicing polygamy?</question>
  <answer>I never did. No sir, never.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>231</questionnumber>
  <question>That is all, -no it is not either, _ I have another question to ask you, and it is this, -Did you ever hear of any one else during the life tie of Joseph Smith teaching or practicing polygamy?</question>
  <answer>No sir, the first I heard of it was in 1845, and I never heard of it before that time by any body.</answer>

  <answer>No sir, I think they were presented about the same. I am not positive about that however, but there was one doctrine and that was about Adam being our God, - I can't say about when that was introduced, - what is something I can't state, but that was a doctrine that I never agreed with, and could not accept for the reason that I could not understand how he could be our God and have fallen under condemnation the way he did; but however that was Brigham Young send a proclamation to that effect our to the people, but whether it was in 1852 or 1854 or 1856 I could not say. I could not say as to the time, for I could not answer as to the time. At any rate I objected to that doctrine, and would not accept it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>295</questionnumber>
  <question>That was one of the doctrines you seriously objected to?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I would not accept it, for it was one of the doctrines I objected to, and polygamy was the other.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>296</questionnumber>
  <question>When you went there were you re-baptized?</question>

  <questionnumber>298</questionnumber>
  <question>That was when you first joined the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>299</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was the occasion of your re-baptism in Salt Lake City?</question>
  <answer>Well it was supposed that the people in crossing the plains at that time, would naturally committ sins, and they considered it was beneficial to be re-baptized.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>300</questionnumber>
  <question>Were all that went there to Salt Lake re-baptized?</question>
  <answer>It was the common practice of all that went there to be re-baptized.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>301</questionnumber>
  <question>That was on the theory that it was the next thing to an impossibility to go across the plains without doing some little sin I suppose?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for the reason I presume that the trip across the plains in those days was on fraught with a great deal of hardship, worry and trouble, and it was supposed that it was impossible for any one to make the trip, and undergo all these difficulties and worriments without sommitting some sin, and therefore they had better be baptized when they arrived there, and that was what was done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>302</questionnumber>
  <question>Was the ordinance of baptism the same?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>303</questionnumber>
  <question>The same as was originally conferred?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was all just for the re-mission of sins.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>304</questionnumber>
  <question>For the remission of sins?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. It was for the re-mission of sins as I understood it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>305</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I will call your attention to what is said to have been the oath required to be taken, or to have been taken I should say, - In the endowment in Salt Lake City?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>306</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it as set out on page six of the exhibit here to fore shown you?</question>
  <answer>Let me see it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>307</questionnumber>
  <question>I now hand you the exhibit that contains what I have called your attention to, and I will ask you to read it if you can find it here, - that is to read the oath that you were required to make in Salt Lake City if you can find it here?</question>
  <answer>I don't remember of taking any oath only to avenge the blood of Joseph the Martyr, and of his brother Hyrum Smith. I find it here to teach your children so and so. Now it might have all been in there at the time I took it but if it was I don't remember it. Now it is just this way. I am satisfied from what I had heard before I took my endowments that there were many things done in the endowment house at one time that were not done at the time I received mine. I am satisfied of that fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>308</questionnumber>

  <answer>Yes sir, I recognize it, but I can't say that I took it at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>311</questionnumber>
  <question>You recognize it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That is what I said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>312</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now would you be kind enough to read it to the Notary?</question>
  <answer>"We were then made to swear to avenge the death of Joseph Smith the martyr, together with that of his brother Hyrum, on this American Nation, and that we would teach our children and children's children to do so. The penalty for this grip and oath was dis embowellment". Now I recognize the part of it that we took to avenge the death of Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, and it may be that I took it all, for I hardly ever did anything on the halves when I was there, but if I did take all of it I do not remember, but as I said before it is altogether probably that I took it all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>313</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then read the part of it after the part that you say you recollect taking?</question>
  <answer>"On this American Nation, and that we would teach our children and our children's children to do so". I presume I took that oath but if I did I don't recollect it. "It goes on as I read before and states that the penalty for this grip and oath was dis embowellment, - I don't recollect that, although I suppose there was a penalty attached to the oath, but I don't recollect that part of it although it is probably that that was it, and I took it.</answer>

  <answer>Not all but the ones who had been baptized into the Utah church were re-baptized again before they were admitted into the re-organized church, but I understand it is not necessary in the case of parties who were baptized into the original church before the death of Joseph Smith, and who have never become identified with the Utah church or any other faction of the original church after the death of Joseph the Seer.</answer>

  <answer>He told me that Joseph came to him at one time, and said to him. "Brother Marks, I am glad that you have not received the teachings of this doctrine, for now we have got to go to work," he said, "and put down this wicked practice, and I want you to call the High Council together, and I will prefer charges against these members of the church who have entered into this practice of plural marriage; and if they do not repent they will be expelled from the church." Now, that is what he said to me, and shortly after that he was arrested and taken to Nauvoo--I mean, to Carthage. He sad that he "had been approached about this matter"--that is, about the matter of plural marriage, and "he had refused to have anything to do with it," and that he wanted the High Council called together to take action on the cases of the members of the church who had violated the marriage law in taking plural wives, and that he would prefer charges against them.</answer>

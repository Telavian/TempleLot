  <answer>Well you may say that they all emigrated as a body. Of course there was some of them did not come west to the mountains, but I may say that the bulk of the church did. Of course Brigham Young led them as a people from Nauvoo, and they followed him from Nauvoo first to winter quarter and from there to this valley. There was some four thousand at first came through with him to this valley,-I do not know the exact number but some four or five thousand I think came here in 1848, and quite a number,-should judge some fifteen hundred or two thousand came through the same season later on. From my memory I could not vouch as to the accuracy of my statements without going to the records, but there are several large companies of the people that followed us the first season, and the next season or summer there was two grand divisions came out here,-I don't know the numbers that were in them, but the records will show that, but I couldn't tell you from memory how many there was, but all the inhabitants of the church, I mean the ones at Nauvoo, or all nearly that were at Nauvoo, came here to the mountains.</answer>

Whereas Brother Richard Hewitt has called on me today to know my views concening some doctrines that are preached in your place, and states to me that some of your elders say that a man having a certain priesthood, may have as many wives as he pleases, and that here; I say unto you that that man teaches false doctrine, for there is no such doctrine taught here, neither is there any such thing practiced here. And any man that is found teaching privately or publicly and such doctrine is culpable, and will stand a chance to be brought before the High Council and lose his license and membership also; therefore, he better beware what he is about.

    </pagenumber>And again I say unto you and elder has no business to undertake to preach mysteries in any part of the world, for God has commanded us all to preach nothing but the first principles unto the world. Neither has any elder any authority to preach any mysterious things to any branch of the church unless he has a direct commandment from God to do so. Let the matter of the grand councils of heaven and the making of gods worlds and devils entirely alone; for you are not called to teach and such doctrine,-for neither you nor the people are capacitated to understand any such principles,-less so to teach them. For when God commands them to teach such principles the saints will receive them. Therefore beware what you teach, for the mysteries of God are not given to all men; and unto those to whom they are given they are placed under restrictions to impart only such as God will command them; and the residue is to be kept in a faithful breast, other wise he will be brought under condemnation. By this God will prove his faithful servants, who will be called and numbered with the chosen. And as to the celestial glory, all will enter in and possess that kingdom that obey the gospel; and continue in faith in the Lord unto the end of his days. Now, therefore, I say unto you, you must cease preaching your miraculous things, and let the mysteries alone until by and by. Preach faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; repentance and baptism for the remission of sins; the laying on of hands for the git of the Holy Ghost; teaching the necessity of strict obedience unto these principles; reasoning out of the scriptures; proving them unto the people. Cease your schisms and divisions, and your contentions. Humble yourselves as in dust and ashes, lest God should make you and ensample of his wrath unto the surrounding world. Amen. In the bonds of the everlasting covenant, I am your obedient servant, Hyrum Smith."

  <answer>Yes sir, I presume it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>108</questionnumber>
  <question>And you were married before a regular minister of the church?</question>

  <question>Well is it not your best recollection Mr. Woodruf that it was the ceremony prescribed by the church, and which was at that time embodied in the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I have repeatedly told you that I cannot remember what the ceremony was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>116</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am not asking you what the ceremony was, -I am asking for your best recollection?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendant objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I say I don't recollect that ceremony, therefore I have not best recollection of it.</answer>

  <question>Now for the purpose of refreshing your recollection I will read paragraph two of section one hundred and eleven, - no it is section one hundred and fifty one in the book of doctrine and covenants in the 1835 edition thereof as follows, - "Marriage should be celebrated with prayer and thanksgiving; and at the solemnization, the persons to be married, standing together, the man on the right, and the woman on the left, shall be addressed, by the person efficiating, as he shall be directed by the Holy Spirit; if their be no legal objection he shall say, calling each by their names; "you both mutually agree to be each others companion, husband and wife, observing the legal right belonging to this condition; that is keeping yourselves wholly for each other, and from all others during your lives". And when they have answered "yes", he shall pronounce them "husband and wife", in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the laws of the country and authority vested in him: "May God add his blessings and keep you to fulfill your covenants from hence forth and forever. Amen". Now I will ask you if that ceremony was administered to you when you were married?</question>
  <answer>Well now I should think it altogether likely it was, but from memory I could not say that it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>121</questionnumber>
  <question>You cannot say then whether that ceremony was performed at the time you were married?</question>
  <answer>No sir, - not from memory, - I couldn't say.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper cross examination. By Mr P.P. Kelley, - "Let the record show that elder John Nuttall is prompting the witness and posting him as to how he should answer the questions asked him." By Mr Nuttall, - "I merely remarked to the witness that in answering these questions, if he did not know how to answer them to say so. That is all that I said to him gentlemen". By The Witness, - "I am an old man and I cannot remember these thing like I once could, and besides all these things happened a great many years ago, and I have some trouble distinguishing what I know myself, of my own knowledge and what was or has been told to me at different times. He was not prompting me as to know I should answer or anything of the kind". By Mr P.P. Kelley, -</mono>

  <answer>Well of course the church has looked upon that temple clock as a place to build a temple upon according to a certain revelation given at an early date in the church, and that is about all there is to it that I can say as to the claim of the church, or answer to the question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>170</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>172</questionnumber>
  <question>We will call your attention to it hereafter Mr Woodruf. Now has there ever been a disclaimer on the part of the church, so far as you know, to any interest in that property? In other words has the church so far as your knowledge extends ever disclaimed any interest in that property?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I have heard of none sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>173</questionnumber>
  <question>There was and has been no official action taken by the church looking towards a disclaimer has there, so far as your knowledge goes?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Well all I can say of course about that is from rumor, or by rumor. I would have heard it by rumor if there had been, and I will say I have not heard of any. I have never heard any man claim the property directly of course, but I have hard rumors.</answer>

  <mono>By Mr Cavell, - "Is that all the questions you desire to ask this witness regarding this temple lot or block at Independence? By Mr Kelley, - "I don't know that it is and I don't know that it is not. I may return to it". By Mr Cabell, - "Well I want to make a motion to strike it all from the record but I want you to get through with it before I do so." By Mr Kelley, - "Well if you want to do a thing, as the fellow said "Now is the time to do it", so make your motion and let us proceed". By Mr Cavell, - "Counsel for the defendants now makes the motion to strike from the record all the evidence of this witness with reference to the contribution of funds for the purpose of buying the temple block at Independence, Missouri, for the reason that it is incompetent, immeterial and flagrant violation of the rules or law with reference to cross examination.

We object to it for the reason that all the evidence that has been given by this witness shows that he does not know it of his own knowledge, but merely states it as a matter of hearsay. That objection goes to the former examination, and we object to this question just asked the witness on the grounds that it is irrelevant and immeterial and incompetent, and not cross examination."

    </pagenumber>the 22nd and 23rd of Sept. 1832, on Priesthood. 1. A revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith, Jr., and six elders as they united their hearts and lifted their voices on high; Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church, established in the last days, for the restoration of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to stand upon mount Zion, which shall be the city New Jerusalem; which city shall be built beginning at the temple lot, which is appointed by the finger of the Lord, in the Western boundaries of the state of Missouri, and dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith, Jr., and others with whom the Lord was well pleased. 2. Verily, this is the word of the Lord, that the City New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation; for verily this generation shall not all pass away until an house shall be built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the house. And the sons of Moses, according to the Holy priesthood which he reveiced under the hands of Caleb, and Caleb received it under the hands of Elihu, and Elihu under the hand of Jeremy, and Jeremy under the hand of Gad, and Gad under the hand of Esias, and Esias received it under the hand of God; Esaias also lived in the days Abraham and was blessed by him, which Abraham received the priesthood from Melchisidek, who recieved it through the lineage of his fathers, even till Noah, and from Noah till Enoch, through the lineage of their fathers, and from Enoch to Abel who was slain by the conspiracy of his brother who received the priesthood by the commandments of God by the hand of his father Adam, who was the first man; which priest hood continued in the church of God in all generations, and is without beginning of days and end of years". Now is that the temple lot in Jackson County, Missouri to which you refer?

  <question>Well what is your best recollection as to that?</question>
  <answer>I cannot say for I was abroad at the time it was given.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and improper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Well in order to answer that question I will say that when ever a revelation was given by the prophet Joseph to the church, it was accepted and received by the church as a general principle, - It was generally received as it came from the prophet.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>222</questionnumber>
  <question>And it was not a part of the church law until it was accepted by the church? Is that not also true?</question>
  <answer>No sir it is not true. That is as I said before. These revelations when they were given were always accepted by the church, and it was not the practice when revelations were given by the prophet for them to be presented to the church for its reception before they became the law and rule of the church. Joseph was looked upon and believed to be a prophet, seer and revelator, and his revelations were invariably accepted by the church without question when presented to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>223</questionnumber>
  <question>But were they not required to be presented to the church for the churches acceptance?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>

  </question>
  <answer>I do not recollect of any law or rule of the church that required that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>225</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know the law of the church that all things should be done by common consent? Don't you know that law, and was not that the law at that time, that all things should be done by common consent within the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir in some things it was, in the matter of the transaction of temporal business, and in the quoroms, etc it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>226</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that not the law of the church that in all affairs pertaining to what should or would be the law of the church that course was to be pursued, the matter was to be submitted to the body for its sanction?</question>
  <answer>I have no recollection of any revelation given to that effect, and yet it might have been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>227</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not a fact that all the revelations that were published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants in the 1835 edition were so submitted to the church and accepted by the church, and formally voted upon?</question>
  <answer>I think there were times at the conferences and other places where the books were all presented to the church. I think that was done, but as to the date and time I could not say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>228</questionnumber>
  <question>What books do you refer to?</question>
  <answer>I think the Bible and Book of Mormon and book of Doctrine and Covenants have been presented to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>229</questionnumber>
  <question>Well were not the revelations that are contained in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, presented to the church, and accepted by the church upon a vote both of all the quorums of the church, and of the members present at a conference before they were ever published in the book of Doctrine and Covenants at all?</question>
  <answer>Not to my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>230</questionnumber>
  <question>Could they put a revelation in the book of Doctrine and Covenants without the sanction of the church, and have it legally done?</question>
  <answer>When those revelations were first published and printed they [they] were taken from the manuscript that contained them, or upon which they have been written with the day and date of their reception by the prophet, and how far the church was called on to sanction them I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>231</questionnumber>
  <question>Were they not presented to the General assembly first?</question>
  <answer>I do not know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>232</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you not read the history of it in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, where they are presented?</question>
  <answer>That may have been done so, but I was not present, and I do not know of course, only what I have read about it or heard about it. As I was not present I cannot say of my own knowledge what was done, and what I have heard or read about it I suppose is immaterial.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>233</questionnumber>
  <question>For the purpose of refreshing your recollection I will read to you from section forty nine, there is only one paragraph in it, it is on page one hundred and seventy nine in Exhibit E, from which I have heretofore read, and which is the 1835 edition of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, as follows, "Revelation to Joseph Smith, Jr., Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer, given July 1830. Behold I say unto you that you shall let your time be devoted to the studying of the scriptures, and to preaching, and to confirming the church at Colesville; until after you shall go to the west to hold the next conference and then it shall be made known what you shall do. And all things shall be done by common consent in the church, by much prayer and faith for all things you shall receive by faith. Amen." Now that is a revelation to Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith and David Whitmer?</question>
  <answer>So it states.</answer>

    <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0001_f0010-Case_testimonies__Pages_1-92-ORIGINAL/28.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 23</a>
  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>234</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was the law on that matter at that time was it not,- the law of common consent? At the time the book of Covenants was received was that not the law?</question>
  <answer>Oh of course the book of covenants was received and accepted.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>235</questionnumber>
  <question>I will now read from paragraph four, section fifty one of the 1835 edition of the book of doctrine and covenants, on page one hundred and eighty one, as follows, - "Thou shalt not leave this place until after the conference and my servant Joseph shall be appointed to preside over the conference by the voice of it, and what he saith to thee though shalt tell. And again thou shalt take they brother Hiram Page between thee and him alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from the stone are not of me, and that satan deceiveth him, for behold these things have not been appointed until him, neither shall anything be appointed to any of this church, contrary to the church covenants, for all things must be done in order and by common consent in the church by prayer of faith." Now that is the paragraph I referred to, and I will ask you now if the church could bound by anything unless it had first been presented to the church for it's approval?</question>
  <answer>They accepted it. The revelations were accepted by the church. Of course there has been times as before remarked when all these books were presented to the conferences.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>236</questionnumber>
  <question>Well would the church be bound by it as church law until they had accepted it?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't answer that exactly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>237</questionnumber>
  <question>You are the president to the church, and you ought to be able to answer a simple little question like that?</question>
  <answer>Of course as I have said before, from the day of the foundation of this church up to the day of the death of the prophet Joseph Smith, whenever he gave a revelation to the church it was accepted by the church before it was presented to any general assembly, because he gave revelations frequently and they were accepted by the people, not in the nature of a formal acceptance, but by reason of the fact that they came to the people and the church as a revelation received from the Lord through the prophet, seer and revelator, whose office it was to receive the commandments of God and deliver them to his chosen people. and of course revelations so received were published in the book of doctrine and covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>238</questionnumber>
  <question>They were not accepted by the people before they knew what they were accepting?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>239</questionnumber>
  <question>All the revelations given to Joseph Smith before his death, were at one time or another presented for adoption?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, either in book form or some other form.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>240</questionnumber>
  <question>Either in bok form or manuscript form?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, in either of the two forms.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>241</questionnumber>
  <question>But the church would not be bound by anything until it had been so presented to and adopted by them would it?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>242</questionnumber>
  <question>I say the church would not be bound by anything until it had been presented to and adopted by them? Would it?</question>
  <answer>I can't say as to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>243</questionnumber>
  <question>Don't you know that has been the practice of the church ever since its organization in 1830 or '29,-that everything must be presented to the church in some form or other for its adoption, before the church can be regularly bound by it?</question>
  <answer>As I said before whenever revelations are given by the church or to the church I should say, -when they are given by the church and printed and delivered to the people, they are accepted by the people. The people have accepted it when that has been done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>244</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now Mr. Woodruf I insist upon the answer to that question</question>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>245</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you haven't answered it yet? The question is this, -Has it not been the practice of the church from the time of its organization down to the present time, and practiced by you since you have been president of this church here, to present everything concerning the doctrine of the church to the church for its adoption, before the church would be bound by it?</question>
  <answer>Well of course. That is a principle of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>246</questionnumber>
  <question>Well sir, I thought so, and that is the principle you went on when you presented the manifesto here for adoption?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, of course.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>247</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the fact is it not?</question>
  <answer>Certainly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>248</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is the principle on or under which the church was governed prior to 1846, - that everything was presented in some form or other for adoption?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>249</questionnumber>
  <question>Presented to the church for adoption?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>250</questionnumber>
  <question>And if not presented to the church for adoption and if not adopted by the church, the church would not be bound by it, as a church?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>251</questionnumber>
  <question>I say if it is not presented to the church and adopted by the church, the church would not be bound by it as a church? Is that not true?</question>
  <answer>Well of course these things depend on circumstances, as I said before. As I said before there has been counsel given and business done, and revelations that have been received, and as a matter of course all the works had to be presented to the church at times.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>252</questionnumber>
  <question>Is counsel the same as church law?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>253</questionnumber>
  <question>Well in my question I am trying to confine you to the church law and nothing else?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I understand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>254</questionnumber>
  <question>Well from your answer I would infer that you do not understand. Well now has it not been the practice of the church, universally, before anything was or became church law, that the church could be bound as a church by, that is it must be presented to the church for adoption, -to the membership of the church for their acceptance or adoption, in some form or other, and at some time?</question>
  <answer>All our business, -all our business that comes before us must come up before our conferences that are held twice a year. All the business of the church we present to the church at these times, but of course we transact business between these times.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>255</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't make church law between these times do you?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I think not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>256</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't make church law or doctrine between those dates do you?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I think not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>257</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you or do you not?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>258</questionnumber>
  <question>Now why wouldn't you answer my question before this Mr. Woodruff?</question>
  <answer>I did answer it as soon as I understood it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>259</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it not true that before anything can be binding upon the church as church law, it must first be presented to the church for adoption, and has that not been invariably the rule since the organization of the church? Now please answer that question squarely and plainly?</question>
  <answer>Well as I said to you in the first place, a great many things were done years before I was in the church, and all those early revelations were accepted by the people as given before they were ever presented to the church, but as to the matter of dividing these things up perhaps I am not qualified to say. You see in the earliest days I was not a member of the church, and I cannot say just as to how things were done then, but that is my understanding.</answer>

  <questionnumber>262</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if the church to which it was presented at a general conference, that embraced a large part of the church, or a majority of the church, should reject it, in that case it would not be binding upon the church as a law of the church? Is that not the fact Mr. Woodruf?</question>

  <answer>Well there has been revelations received by the pole, revelations as I said before, revelations that were given by the prophet and were accepted by the people, before they were accepted in the Conferences. Now that is the only question or difference between you and me on that matter, - you insist that they have all been presented to the conferences or assemblies of the people an accepted by the in that capacity and in that way before they became a law binding on the church, and I say that there have been revelations given through the prophet, that have been accepted and acted upon by the people before they were every accepted formally in the conferences nor assemblies. Of course they have been presented to the Conferences and accepted or projected as the case might be.</answer>

    By Mr Hall, - "We have no objection if Mr Woodruf has not". There being no objection to the foregoing, the following copy of the section referred to in the question, to wit, - Section 124. Revelation given to Joseph Smith, at Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois, January 19th, 1840. 1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, which you have made, for unto this end, have I raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth. 2 Your prayers are acceptable before me, and in answer to them, I say unto you, that you are now called immediately to make a solemn proclamation of my gospel, and of this Stake which I have planted to be a corner stone of Zion, which shall be polished with that refinement which is after the similtude of a palace. 3 This proclamation shall be made to all the kings of the world, - to the four corners thereof, - to the honorable President elect, and the high minded govenors of the nation in which you live, and to all the nations of the earth scattered abroad. 4 Let it be written in the spirit of meekness and by the power of the Holy Ghost, which shall be in you at the time of the writing of the same; 5 For it shall be given you by the Holy Ghost to know my will concerning those things and authorities, even what shall befall them in a time to come. 6 For behold, I am about to call upon them to give heed to the light and glory of Zion, for the set time come to favor her. 7 Call ye therefore, upon me, with loud proclamation, and with your testimony, fearing them not, for they are as grass; and all their glory as the flower thereof which soon falleth, that they may be left also without excuse. 8 And that I may visit them in the day of visitation, when I shall unveil the face of my covering, to appoint the portion of the oppressor among hypocrites, where there is gnashing of teeth, if they reject my servants and my testimony which I have revealed unto them. 9 And again I will visit and soften their hearts, many of them for your good, that ye may find grace in their eyes, that they may come to the light of truth, and the Gentiles to the exaltation of lifting up of Zion. 10 For the day of my visitation cometh spedily, in an hour when ye think not of, and where shall be the safety of my people, and refuge for those who shall be left of them. 11 Awake, O ye kings of earth. Come ye, O come ye, with your gold and your silver, to the help of my people, to the house of the daughters of Zion. 12 And again, verily I say unto you, Let my servant Robert E. Thompson help you to write this proclamation, for I am well pleased with him, and that he should be with you. 13 Let him therefore hearken unto your counsel, and I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings; let him be faithful and true in all things from henceforth, and he shall be great in mine eyes. 14 But let him remember that his stewards ip will require at his hands. 15 And again, verily I say unto you blessed is my servant

    </pagenumber>for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord. 16 And again, let my servant John C. Bennett, help you in your labor in sending my word to the kings of the people of the earth, and stand by you, even you my servant Joseph Smith, in the hour of alliction, and his reward shall not fall if he receive counsel; 17 And for his love he shall be great, for he shall be mine if he do this, saith the Lord. I have seen the work which he hath done, which I accept, if he continue, and will crown him with blessings and great glory. 18 And again I say unto you, that it is my will that my servant Lyman Wight should continue in preaching for Zion, in the spirit of meekness confessing me before the world, and I bear him up on eagles wings, and he shall beget glory and honor to himself, and unto my name. 19 That when he shall finish his work, that I may receive him unto myself, even as I did my servant David Patten, who is with me at this time, and also my servant Edward Partridge, and also my aged servant Joseph Smith, sen., who sitteth with Abraham at his right had, and blessed and holy is he, for he is mine. 20 And again, verily I say unto you, my servant George Miller is without guile; he may be trusted because of the integrity of his heart; and for the love which he has to my testimony I, the Lord, love him. 21 I therefore say unto you, I seal upon his head the office of bishopric, like unto my servant Edward Partridge, that he man receive the consecrations of mine house, that he may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor of my people, saith the Lord. Let no man despise my servant George, for he shall honor me. 22 Let my servant George, and my servant Lyman, and my servant John Snider, and others, build a house unto my name, such an one as my servant Joseph shall show unto them; upon the place which he shall show unto them also. 23 And it shall be for a house of boarding, a house that strangers may come from afar to lodge therein; therefore, let it be a good house worthy of all acceptation, that the weary traveler may find health and safety while he shall contemplate the word of the Lord; and the corner stone I have appointed for Zion. 24 This house shall be a healthy habitation if it be build into my name, and if the governor that shall be appointed unto it not suffer any pollution to come upon it. It shall be holy, or the Lord, you God will not dwell therein. 25 And again, verily I say unto you, let all my saints come from afar. 26 And send ye swift messengers, yea, chosen messengers, and say unto them; come ye, with all your gold, and you silver, and your precious, stone, and with all you antiquities; and with all who have knowledge of antiquities that will come, may come, and bring the box tree, and the fir tree, and the pine tree, together with all the precious trees of the earth. 27 And with iron, with copper and with brass, and with zinc, and with all your precious things of the earth, and build a house to my name for the Most High to dwell therein; 28 For there is not a place found on earth that he may come and restore again that which was lost unto you, or which he hath taken away, even the fullness of the priesthood; 29 For a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my saints, may be baptized for those who are dead. 30 For this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be acceptable to me, only in the days of your poverty, wherein ye

      </pagenumber>June 22nd, 1834.,
    </mono>1 Verily I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that you may learn my will concerning the redemption of mine afflicted people. 2 Behold, I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my people, speaking concerning the church, and not individuals, they might have been redeemed even now; 3 But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I require at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil, and do not impart of their substance as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted among them. 4 And are not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom. 5 And Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of the celestial kingdom, otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself. 6 And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer. 7 I speak not concerning those who are appointed to lead my people who are the first elders of the church, for they are not all under this condemnation; 8 But I speak concerning my churches abroad, -there are many who will say, where is their God? Behold, he will deliver them in time of trouble, otherwise we will not go up into Zion, and we well keep our moneys. 9 Therefore in consequence of the transgressions of my people, it is expedient in me that mine elders should wait for a little season for the redemption of Zion. 10 That they themselves may be prepared, and that my people may be taught more perfectly, and have experience, and know more perfectly concerning their duty, and the things which I require at their hands. 11 And this cannot be brought to pass until mine elders are endowed with powers from on High; 12 For behold I have prepared a great endowment and blessing to be poured out upon them, inasmuch as they are faithful and continue in humility before me; 13 Therefore, it is expedient in me that mine elders should wait for a little season, for the redemption of Zion. 14 For behold, I do not require at their hands to fight the battles of Zion; for as I said in a former commandment, even so will I fulfill. I will fight your battles. 15 Behold, the destroyer I have set forth to destroy and lay waste mine enemies; and not many years hence they shall not be left to pollute mine inheritage, and to blaspheme my name upon the lands which I have consecrated for the gathering together of my saints. 16 Behold I have commanded my servant Baurak Ale (Joseph Smith Jr.,) to say unto the strength of my house, even my warriors, my young men, and middle aged, to gather together for the redemption of my people, and throw down the towers of mine enemies, and scatter their watchman; 17 But the strength of mine house have not hearkened unto my words; 18 But inasmuch as there are those who have hearkened unto my words I have prepared a blessing and an endowment for them if they continue faithful. 19 I have heard their prayers, and will accept their offering; and it is expedient in me, that they should be brought thus far for a trial of their faith. 20 And now, verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto you, that as many as have come up hither, that can stay in the region round about let them stay; 21 For those that cannot stay, who have families in the east let them

I Verily thus saith the Lord, I require all their surplus property to be put in the hands of the bishop of thy church of Zion. 2 For the building of mine house, and for the laying of the foundation of Zion, and for the priesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my church. 3 And this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people. 4 And after that, those that have been tithed, shall pay one tenth of their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them for ever, for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord. 5 Verily, I say unto you, it shall come to pass that all those who gather to the land of Zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties, and shall observe this law, or they shall not be found worth to abide among you. 6 And I say unto you, if my people observe not this law, to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify the land of Zion unto me that my statues and judgements shall be kept thereon, that it may be most holy, behold verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you; 7 And this shall be an ensample unto all the stakes of Zion.

      <question>Yes sir, during the year 1843?</question>
      <answer>I do not recollect now, I do not recollect any special occurence of that kind, but I supposed they always baptized for the dead there in the font as long as they had a chance. Now that is my view to it, but I don't remember any particular instance where it was done, but I suppose they did.</answer>

      <question>That is your view of it, but you don't know that they did it?</question>
      <answer>Well I will tell you just this much. I can't tell the date of it, but I baptized me in the font myself, and saw others do the same thing before we left there, but as to the dates of course I could not say without referring to my minutes.</answer>

      <question>Well the font was not ready in 1843 was it, - is it not a fact Mr Woodruf that the font was not ready in 1843 for baptisms?</question>
      <answer>
        I don't know sir. History of course will give an account of that. I know the fact sir, but as to the date I could not say from memory. Now if you gentlemen have any interest in searching these principles and particulars out, those last letters that Joseph Smith wrote just prior to his death, - these two last letters dwelt extensively on the question of these ordinances, the ordinance of baptism for the dead, etc. but with regard to days and dates, I can

      <question>The letters you spoke of in the last preceding interrogatory were written in 1842, were they not?</question>
      <answer>I do not know.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>318</questionnumber>
      <question>Well what is your best recollection as to that?</question>
      <answer>I could not say with any degree of certainty when it was, I would have to see them in the books to tell. I cannot remember when they were written but they are in the books and the books of course speak for themselves.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>319</questionnumber>
      <question>Are you sure they are there?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, I am pretty sure they are, - at least I think they are if I am not greatly mistaken, you say they were written in 1842, but it appears to me they were later than that, however, I don't know.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>320</questionnumber>
      <question>The dates in the book are September first 1842 and September 6th 1842.</question>
      <answer>Well they are in the last parts of the books, and I thought they must be later than that. They are speaking of the baptism for the dead, and doctrines like that kind.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>321</questionnumber>
      <question>I will ask you if those are the two letters you refer to, the one one page two hundred and twenty of the book of doctrine and covenants, section one hundred and nineteen, - it is page four hundred and forty eight, section one hundred and twenty seven and one hundred and twenty eight in Exhibit A, - here it is Mr. Woodruf in one of your own publications (handing witness Exhibit A) probably you can tell better by that than the other book?</question>
      <answer>(witness examines the section referred to and says) it is in sections one hundred and twenty seven and eight that I was alluding to. Those are the letters.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>322</questionnumber>

      </question>
      <answer>I do not recollect. There was meetings held in the masonic hall. We held a good many meetings in the hall called the "Masonic Hall".

  <questionnumber>371</questionnumber>
      <question>Well if they had been carried on there, do you think you would have known it?</question>
      <answer>I think so. Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>372</questionnumber>
      <question>Now in your direct examination the other day your attention was called to paragraph thirtynine on page four hundred and thirty four of Exhibit A, being the book of doctrine and covenants of the 1890 edition, published by your church here in Salt Lake City, as identifying the ordinance there. Now how are you able to tell that the ordinances mentioned in that section are the ordinance that you say you performed there in Nauvoo?</question>
      <answer>What is the meaning of that section?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>373</questionnumber>
      <question>Well I will read it, - "Therefore verity I say unto you that your annointings and your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn assemblies, and for your oracles in your most holy places, wherein you receive conversations, and your statues and judgements for the beginning of the revelations and foundation of Zion, and for the glory, honor and endowments of all her municipals, are ordained by the ordinance of my hold house which my people are always commanded to build unto my hold name". Now sir do you say that the ordinance administered there in the Masonic Hall, - partly in the Masonic Hall at Nauvoo and partly at other places were the ordinances spoken of in this revelation?</question>
      <answer>Well the baptisms for the dead were administered in the first place in the river, and then in the font in the temple that was built for that purpose. Of course they were administered in different places according to the different ordinances.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>374</questionnumber>
      <question>You had a special order, - a special command for administering then in the river did you not?</question>
      <answer>Well there was a revelation given to Joseph Smith concerning baptism for the dead.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>375</questionnumber>
      <question>That is the fact?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>376</questionnumber>
      <question>Thee was a special revelation in relation to baptism for the dead?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>377</questionnumber>
      <question>Well did it not command that the ordinance of the baptism for the dead should be performed in the temple, and no where else?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>378</questionnumber>
      <question>It did not?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>379</questionnumber>
      <question>And you swear to that?</question>
      <answer>No sir. Not when this revelation was first given concerning the dead.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>380</questionnumber>
      <question>And that you swear to?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. Of course when you have a temple the order of God has always been, - or at least has been supposed to be in our day, that when there is a temple the ordinance must be administered in it, but when there is no temple it may be administered outside of the temple.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>381</questionnumber>
      <question>Then you say the order was to administer it outside of the temple of the river until the temple was completed?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>382</questionnumber>
      <question>Where did that order come from?</question>
      <answer>
        That was the order of the

        </pagenumber>prophet Joseph.
      </answer>
      
  <questionnumber>383</questionnumber>
      <question>Was permission given by Joseph, or by the Lord either for these other ordinances to be performed outside of the temple,-for instance the ordinances of anointing or washing?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir they have been done outside of the temple.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>384</questionnumber>
      <question>Well was there an order or authority from the Lord or the prophet either for that?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. 385 (XXXXXXXX out) 386 (XXXXXXXX out rest not readable. New line started) 386 Well will you give me the revelation permitting or authorizing that practice?</answer>
      <answer>No sir, I couldn't do it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>387</questionnumber>
      <question>Can you cite me to your authority for that practice?</question>
      <answer>I want to understand this one thing,-Joseph Smith was a prophet, seer and revelator, and was so acknowledged by the saints, and whatever he said or counseled in these things, or in these matters was accepted.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>388</questionnumber>
      <question>Was he higher than the law?</question>
      <answer>Greater than the law that God has revealed through Joseph Smith?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>389</questionnumber>
      <question>Yes sir?</question>
      <answer>No sir, but he was the medium through which the law was revealed.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>390</questionnumber>
      <question>How was the prophet to give the word of God?</question>
      <answer>How was the prophet to give the word of God. He was the prophet through which the word of God was revealed to all man kind.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>391</questionnumber>
      <question>Well after the law had been revealed to him, them was he, the prophet, higher and greater than the law so revealed to him?</question>
      <answer>I do not understand what you mean?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>392</questionnumber>
      <question>I mean that after the law had been revealed, was he not then subject to the law the same as any other person?</question>
      <answer>He was the law giver himself.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>393</questionnumber>
      <question>Well was he not subject to the law he gave himself?</question>
      <answer>I suppose he was.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>394</questionnumber>
      <question>You suppose he was,-as a matter of fact wasn't he?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>395</questionnumber>
      <question>You do not mean to say that he was the law maker?</question>
      <answer>He was the law giver to the church, because he was the prophet, seer and revelator, and all the laws that came to the church cam through his mouth, therefore you might call him the law giver,-I know I do.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>396</questionnumber>
      <question>That is he received the laws from God and communicated them to you, or rather to the church?</question>
      <answer>
        Yes sir.
		</answer>
        
  <questionnumber>397</questionnumber>Now after a law had been received from God and communicated to the church in that manner through the medium of Joseph Smith as prophet, seer and revelator was higher than the law,-higher than the law so received? In other words could he violate that law unless my direct command of God?
      </answer>
      <answer>No sir, I do not say that, but I do say he governed and controlled all these things.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>398</questionnumber>
      <question>After a law had been revealed from the Lord, was it possible in your opinion for the law to change that law by revealing something that was contrary to his law previously reveal a certain and contrary doctrine,-would reveal a certain thing to Joseph Smith in 1841, and then reveal a contrary doctrine in 1842?</question>
      <answer>No sir I don't know that I would,-but as I say, or have said before with regard to all your questionings on these things,- prophet himself stood at the head, and received counsel from the Lord, and he dictated to the church in regard to these things, and revealed matters and things to the church as he was moved upon by the power of the Holy Spirit.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>399</questionnumber>

        </pagenumber>"And again, verily I say unto you, how shall your washings be acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house that you have built unto my name?
      </question>
      <answer>Well that is all right.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>400</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you say sir that these washings were acceptable unto the Lord.</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>401</questionnumber>
      <question>Yes do?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, we think so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>402</questionnumber>
      <question>Were they performed in a house that was built unto the Lord?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>403</questionnumber>
      <question>They were?</question>
      <answer>We think so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>404</questionnumber>
      <question>Was the Masonic Temple a house built for the Lord?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>405</questionnumber>
      <question>Please explain then how it comes that they were acceptable unto the Lord, if it was not a house built unto the Lord?</question>
      <answer>Well I didn't say there were any washings in the Masonic Temple, but there was meetings held in the Masonic Temple.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>406</questionnumber>
      <question>It was just a store room was it not?</question>
      <answer>No sir, it was a hall built above the store room.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>407</questionnumber>
      <question>Where that was performed?</question>
      <answer>No sir, we do not understand each other. We are talking about two different things. There were certain ordinances performed in the store there for there was not a temple built at that time. It was just as it was in this city, for there was a great many ordinances performed there at that time the same as there has been here, for there was not a temple built at the time, and they were performed out side of a temple for that reason. When there is no temple it is impossible to perform these ordinances in a temple, - for the reason that there is no temple in which to perform them. It was the way it was here before there was a proper places built expressly for that purpose, - rooms were set apart and dedicated to that purpose.</answer>

      <question>Now do you claim that these washings and annointings performed there under these circumstances, were the washings and annointings referred to in paragrapg thirty seven that I have just read. I will read paragraph thirty nine on page four hundred and thirty four of Exhibit A, again. It was read to you the other day of your direct examination, and I will call your attention to it again. It is as follows, - "Therefore, verily, I say unto you, that you annointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices, by the sons of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places, wherein you receive conversations, and your statues and judgements for the beginning of revelations and foundation of Zion, and for the glory, honor and endowment of all her municipals, are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name". Now I will ask you again if you claim that the washings and annointings performed under the circumstances you have just stated, are the washings and annointings referred to in the paragraph I have just read?</question>
      <answer>Well now I don't recollect just how that reads, but there are certain things referred to there as I understand it in that paragraph, -</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>410</questionnumber>

      </question>
      <answer>A portion of them are, - we have always had permission, -</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>413</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now, did you not state in your examination in chief that those are the identical annointings that you received there? Did you not state that to Mr Hall when he was examining you the other day?</question>
      <answer>What is that?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>414</questionnumber>
      <question>That the annointings and washings referred to here in paragraph thirty nine of this revelation on page four hundred and thirty four of Exhibit A, of the defendants, were the washings and annointings you received in Nauvoo?</question>
      <answer>Well it is as I said, there are different washings performed in these ordinances, and some of them were performed there.</answer>

      <question>Now I will read you paragraph forty of this same revelation on page four hundred and thirty four of Exhibit A, - "And verily I say unto you, let this house be built unto my name, that I may reveal mine ordinances therein, unto my people". Now do you claim that the ordinances referred to in the preceding paragraph were being performed there, before there was any house erected unto the Lord?</question>
      <answer>I will say they were being performed before we had any house, when there was no house erected for that purpose there was rooms or buildings taken and dedicated to the Lord for the performance of the ordinances. There was a time in the migration of the church from one place to another when of necessity there could not be any house specially erected for that purpose. So it was at Nauvoo, and so it was here in the early days.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>417</questionnumber>
      <question>But the revelation says the house must be built in which the Lord will reveal his ordinances?</question>

      <question>Well then why do you say the ordinance of washing and annointings and baptisms for the dead, that were revealed here in 1841 were revealed and practiced at Kirtland?</question>
      <answer>I did not say that.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>433</questionnumber>
      <question>Well if you did not say that I would like to know what you did say?</question>
      <answer>I said there were ordinances revealed at Kirtland.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>434</questionnumber>
      <question>These were not revealed though?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, - No sir, - they were not practiced.</answer>

      <question>Were they revealed at the time of the giving of the revelation in 1841?</question>
      <answer>What date is given there?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>436</questionnumber>
      <question>Well never mind the date, - were they known to the church prior to the giving of the revelation of 1841?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>437</questionnumber>
      <question>They were not known to the church until the time they were made known in 1841?</question>
      <answer>They were not known to the church before the time they were revealed.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>438</questionnumber>
      <question>And these ordinances or endowments revealed in that revelation were to be conferred or practiced in a house built unto the Lord were they not? Is that not the fact Mr Woodruf?</question>
      <answer>Well that revelation was given before the temple was built was it not?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>439</questionnumber>
      <question>It was given in 1841?</question>
      <answer>Well that was before the temple was built. There was no temple at Nauvoo then, - never was a completed one.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>440</questionnumber>
      <question>But this revelation says don't it that they were to be revealed in a house built unto the name of the Lord, - it says "that these ordinances might be revealed, which had been hid since before the world was?</question>
      <answer>I don't know about that.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>441</questionnumber>
      <question>Read paragraph forty of that same section and see if that is not so?</question>
      <answer>"Therefore I say unto you that your annointings and your washings; "I am reading the one before it too, - "and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices by the sons of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places, wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes and judgements, for the beginning of revelation and foundation of Zion, and for the glory, honor, and endowment of her municipals, are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name.

      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>446</questionnumber>
      <question>Now were these ordinance revealed in 1841 before this temple was built?</question>
      <answer>I do not know that I can say postively in regard to that?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>447</questionnumber>
      <question>
        Now then is this not true Mr Woodruf that that ordinance

        </pagenumber>could not have been revealed at that time, for it says that it will not be revealed until there is a house or temple built in which to practice the ordinance or endowment, and the fact is that at that time there was no such an house of temple built?
      </question>
      <answer>Well I will say this gentlemen, - Joseph Smith was killed before that house was built or completed, and these revelations were given by Joseph Smith before his death. Now there are two facts about which there can be no manner of a dispute or question.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>448</questionnumber>
      <question>What revelations?</question>
      <answer>They were delivered before his death. That is a fact, and it is also a fact that these ordinances were revealed before his death, and also practiced before his death in precisely the same manner that they have been administered since his death.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>449</questionnumber>
      <question>Where is the revelation revealing the ordinance in annointing, washing and baptism for the dead, as spoken of in paragraph thirty nine on page four hundred and thirty four of Exhibit A in the revelation of 1841?</question>

  <questionnumber>452</questionnumber>
      <question>I asked you if there was nay revelation to your knowledge in manuscript that revealed these ordinances referred to in the revelation of 1841, and revealed likewise the manner in which it or they were to be administered?</question>
      <answer>Well these ordinances were given, - they have been given, and practiced too, - whether they were published or not. They were given and practiced and carried out by the prophet. They were carried out by his instructions and given to the church, - or given to the elders of the church.</answer>
      <mono>By Mr E.L. Kelley, -</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>453</questionnumber>
      <question>The question is whether there was a revelation to that effect or not, and if so do you know anything about such a revelation. That is the question Mr Woodruf?</question>

      <question>Well will you say that there was ever a revelation reduced to writing at any time, or at any place, from the time of the foundation of the church, up to the present day, revealing the washings and annointings referred to in paragraph thirty nine of this revelation and if so give me the revelation, the date of the revelation, and where it was given, or the book wherein I can find it?</question>
      <answer>They are not published, - the ordinances revealing these things are not published, - they have never been printed.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>455</questionnumber>
      <question>Were they in manuscript, - were they ever in manuscript, or are they now in manuscript?</question>

        </pagenumber>I have heard them read, or parts of them.

  <questionnumber>460</questionnumber>
      <question>Did you ever read them your self from the manuscript?</question>
      <answer>Well I can't say. What do you mean? I do not understand what you mean, - in what way?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>461</questionnumber>
      <question>I asked you if you had ever read these ordinances from the original manuscript?</question>
      <answer>Well I don't know that I ever read these ordinances as they were given by the prophet in the original maniscript. I can't say that I did that. I may have done so, but if I ever did I have forgotten it, or don't recollect so that I can say with positive assurance as to that.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>462</questionnumber>
      <question>Did you ever see the original manuscript that contained them?</question>
      <answer>I do not recollect that either, I will say just this to this company of men assembled here, those ordinances were not given, -</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>463</questionnumber>
      <question>Of course that is not responsive to my question, and I object to your saying anything about it. I want you to answer my questions Mr Woodruf, and if you cannot do so, why simply say you can't. What you were going to say is not responsive to my question?</question>
      <answer>I know it, but I want to say it nevertheless, - Those ordinances that were given in connection with the conferring of these endowments were given by instruction that is not public to the world, - in other words as the ordinances were administered, the manner and form of doing it is not made to the world, no more so than the ordinances of the Masonic or any other secret orders ordinances or endowments are made public to the world. Now of course with reference to the ordinance of baptism that has been known to ever body that has been at all acquainted with the manner of baptism, for there was nothing secret about that. Baptism for the dead is an ordinance that was publicly practiced there at Nauvoo before the death of the prophet, and it is one that is well known and is one also of the ordinances referred to in that revelation a part of which I have read here.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>464</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now in your direct examination the other day, - Well I will move the court to exclude that answer from the record on the ground that it is not responsive to the question asked the witness. Now in your direct examination the other day by Mr Hall, you were asked to read section forty four, paragraph three of the 1835 edition of the book of doctrine and covenants for the purpose of showing that certain things therein mentioned were not to be shown or given to the world?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>465</questionnumber>
      <question>You recollect that?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. I recollect about that.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>466</questionnumber>
      <question>I will ask you now if the things that were spoken of in that revelation were not to be revealed unto the church?</question>
      <answer>They were taught to the church, - that is they were taught to individuals in the church, as they received these ordinances. When they received the ordinances, they were taught certain things, and and these were amongst the one so taught.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>467</questionnumber>
      <question>They were presented to the church for its acceptance as a body, - or as a church?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>

      <answer>
        The principles were given there at that time, and were accepted by the church. Those revelations

        </pagenumber>on the endowments or ordinances were accepted there at that time, but there was nothing said about baptism, and I don't think that any of the endowments were given there at that time, -
      </answer>
      
  <questionnumber>472</questionnumber>
      <question>Then there was no such a thing as endowments then from, - up to 1835 or '37?</question>
      <answer>To '37?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>473</questionnumber>
      <question>Yes sir?</question>
      <answer>Well now of course these revelations on the endowments wee presented to, - I believe they were presented for the conferences; but I cannot say as to that, for I was not present but that is my understanding about it. 474 (Mistakenly written as 473)</answer>
      <question>Now what endowments do you refer to, - those that are mentioned or spoken of in paragraph three in section forty four of the 1835 edition of the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
      <answer>That speaks of the ordinances of the church, but it does not five the ceremonies to be preformed under these ordinances, - they are not revealed, that is the ceremonies attending the performance of the ordinances are not revealed, - that is the idea I wanted to convey.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>475</questionnumber>
      <question>Well did you say that that revelation, - well let me call you attention again to paragraph three, section forty four, book of doctrine and covenants. You remember that Mr Hall would let you read but two lines of it?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir I remember, but if you want me to read the whole of it I say I can't do so without my glasses (witness gets his glasses). I don't see it. Some of you gentlemen will have to read it for me.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>476</questionnumber>
      <question>Just read the entire paragraph please?</question>
      <answer>I can't do it. Will you read it for me (speaking to Mr Nutall). Mr Nutall reads the praragraph referred to as follows, - (the paragraph referred to is attached on the margin of this page: 50 and made a part thereof.</answer>

      <question>Now I will ask you Mr Woodruf if these things spoken of in this section just read to you are referred, - refer to annointings washings and baptism that are referred to in paragraph thirty nine of the revelation of 1841?</question>
      <answer>I don't know that they do.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>478</questionnumber>
      <question>Does it not refer to things that preceded it in the same paragraph i which the language is found?</question>
      <answer>What language do you refer to?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>479</questionnumber>
      <question>"These things, : "show these things"?</question>
      <answer>I do not believe that I heard that paragraph correctly, - let me see it, - I believe I can read it with a little trouble, - (Witness hereupon reads paragrapg) "And show these things, -"</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>480</questionnumber>
      <question>Read the whole of it, - the whole of that paragraph, -?</question>
      <answer>
        Again it is written eternal damnation; wherefore it is more express than other scriptures, that it might work upon the hears of the children of men altogether for my names glory; wherefore I will explain unto you this mystery, for it is meet unto you, to know even as mine apostles. I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing, even as one, that you may enter into my rest. For behold the mystery of Godliness, how great is it? for behold I am endless, and the punishment, for endless is my name, wherefore eternal punishment is God's punishment; endless punishment is God's punishment; wherefore I command you to repent, and keep the commandments which you have received by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jr., in my name, and it is by my almighty power that you have received the, therefore I command you to repent, repent lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore, how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not. Yea, how hard to bear you know not. For behold, I God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent, but if they would not repent they must suffer

        </pagenumber>heavens and all the hosts thereof"?
      </question>
      <answer>Well sir of course you will see from these revelations that the Lord gave commandments and principals, and such things that were not revealed to the world until such timrs. That is a principle that has been manifest in the dealings of God with men to a greater or lesser degree in all ages. There were or are certain revelations that were given to the church, and to the whole world, - every body that chose to receive them, and certain other revelations that were given to the church only, and certain revelations were given to the church that the church was to keep until a certain time when they should be made manifest to the world. That was the way it was in the days of the prophet, and was in the time of Christ.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>488</questionnumber>
      <question>Then this injunction that the things spoken of in this revelation should not be published to the world is the fact, but thee is or was no injunction that they should not be published to the church?</question>
      <answer>Well now in regard to that I will say that there was things given to Joseph Smith or through Joseph Smith, that were revealed to him, that he kept to himself, and there was other things given to Joseph Smith in the way of revelation that he did reveal to certain individuals in the church, and which he did not reveal to the bulk or body of the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>489</questionnumber>
      <question>But he did not reveal anything to the church that he was prohibited from revealing to the church?</question>
      <answer>No sir, unless God required it not to be revealed, - in other words he only revealed that to the church which God directed him to reveal to the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>490</questionnumber>
      <question>Now I want to refresh your recollection by reading a part of paragraph six of section one hundred on page two hundred and fifteen of the 1836 edition of the book of doctrine and Covenants. I will read the whole paragraph so that you can see the connection. "And for this cause that men might be made partakers of the glories which were to be revealed, the Lord sent forth the fulness of his gospel his everlasting covenant, reasoning in simplicity, to prepare the weak for those things which are coming on the earth; and for the Lord's errand in the day when the weak shall confound the wise, and the little one become a strong nation, and two shall put the or tens of thousands of flight; and by the weak things of the earth the Lord should thresh the nations by the power of his Spirit. And for this cause these commandments were given; they were commanded to be kept from the world in the day they were given, but now are commanded to go forth unto all flesh. And this according to the mind and will of the Lord, who ruleth over all flesh; and unto him that repenteth and sanctifieth himself before the Lord, shall be given eternal life". Now that don't refer to keeping them from the church does it?</question>
      <answer>No it don't appear that way.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>491</questionnumber>
      <question>Sr does not command that they shall be kept from the church?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>492</questionnumber>
      <question>Now your attention was called to the epistle of Matthew, seventeenth chapter and ninth and thirteenth verses, - the ninth verse of the thirteenth chapter and the tenth verse also, where it says that Jesus did not teach certain thing to the world, but refers to them as being taught to the persons within the kingdom but not to those out of the kingdom. Did you understand the world referred to there, included the church too?</question>
      <answer>No sir, and if it was not in that language I would not think it did.</answer>

      <question>You don't recollect that, - is that what you desire to be understood as saying?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, I have read the bible and a good many other books also, but I can't remember everything that is in them.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>496</questionnumber>
      <question>Now I will read the fourth verse of the twelth chapter od second Corinthians, - "how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter". Do you understand that as teaching there shall be a law of the church that the church as a church shall not know?</question>
      <answer>I do not know myself that that has any reference to the church. I am sure I do not know.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>497</questionnumber>
      <question>Well don't you know it does not have any reference to the church?</question>
      <answer>I suppose.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>498</questionnumber>
      <question>If you were expounding that fourth verse how would you do it?</question>
      <answer>Well let me read it and I will tell you something about that possibly. I would like to know what you are talking about.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>499</questionnumber>
      <question>Well I will read it, - "How that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter". I will read from the beginning of the chapter, - "It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body I cannot tell, God knoweth) such an one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man (whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell; God knoweth) How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter". Now do you understand that as referring to the church?</question>
      <answer>I do not know that it has any reference to the church. I do not know that it has anything to do with the church in particular. That was with reference to a circumstance that occured in the days of Christ or the days of the apostles.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>500</questionnumber>
      <question>Does that refer to any law of the church that the church should not know?</question>
      <answer>I do not understand that it does particularly. Of course there was things manifestly that the church was not to know, - that they were not to reveal to the church, or were not to be revealed to the church, - but not to be revealed to the world. Now you know just about s much about it as I do, for these things are recorded in the days of the history of Christ, and what they mean is largely a matter of construction, for it is over these things amongst others that the Christian world has been at war, so to speak, for in numbers of years, - over the construction to be placed upon these matters. Of course as I said they are recorded in the histories of the days of Christ, and the days of the apostles, and I don't know that it has any particular reference to us as a church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>501</questionnumber>
      <question>Now what office did you hold in the church in the days of Joseph Smith, - say during the year 1842?</question>

      <question>Now I will ask you what the law of the church, and the rules of the church on marriage were, in 1842?</question>
      <answer>
        Well the rules of the church were the same as they had been so far as I know, - That is with reference to the common marriage in the church in the common

      </answer>
      
  <questionnumber>505</questionnumber>
      <question>Were there any un-common ones then? You say there were or was no change in the "common marriage" law, was there any un-common ones at that time?</question>
      <answer>Well I say that because at that time Joseph Smith had revealed to me the patriarchal order of marriage, which had been revealed to him, and he practiced it afterwards. He practiced it at that time, and of course it was different from the other common form of marriage.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>506</questionnumber>
      <question>No you say that Joseph Smith revealed to you the patriarchal order of marriage at that time?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, some time about then.</answer>

      <question>That was the same as the plural marriage system?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>508</questionnumber>
      <question>When was it revealed?</question>

  <questionnumber>509</questionnumber>
      <question>How do you know that?</question>
      <answer>Because of his testimony.</answer>

      <question>When did he testify to it?</question>
      <answer>Well sir he testified to it a year before his death.</answer>

      <question>And that was in 1842 you say?</question>
      <answer>What?</answer>

      <question>The year before his death?</question>
      <answer>No no, it was quite a time before his death that he revealed it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>513</questionnumber>
      <question>U to 1842 Mr Woodruf, - in the very last of the year 1842, was there any law or regulation or rule of the church that permitted any man to have more wives than one, or any other form of marriage authoritive in the church, excepting that provided for in the book of doctrine and covenants, or the 1835 edition?</question>
      <answer>Well Joseph Smith received a revelation from God at a very age of the church which never was revealed to the church during his life, - never revealed either openly or privately to the church as a body, but were revealed to individuals members of the church. Now that is according to his testimony, and of course that is all I know about it. There was nothing printed that was revealed in that way, and nothing published up to a certain time that that revelation was given, and the whole thing was kept a secret excepting so far as it was revealed to individuals of the church. There was nothing published up to a certain time that that revelation on the patriarchal order of marriage was given, and I don't remember what the date of it was, but I know what law was revealed to Joseph Smith in so far as his testimony goes to that effect, and that was a long time before it was ever published to the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>514</questionnumber>
      <question>Now Mr Woodruf you have made a very long answer and still you have not answered my question. My question is, - was there up to the very last of the year 1842 any rule or law of the church that permitted any man to have more than one wife, or any other form of marriage authoritive in the church excepting that provided for in the bok of doctrine and covenants of the edition of 1835?</question>
      <answer>There was no law given to the church as a church, or as a body, but there was a rule or revelation given to the prophet Joseph Smith, which he practiced himself, if the testimony of those who are still living regarding it is true.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>515</questionnumber>
      <question>How do you know Mr Woodruf of your own knowledge that there was any law revealed to Joseph Smith, contrary to the law of marriage as set forth in the book of doctrine and covenants of the 1835 edition?</question>
      <answer>I do not know only as I said before from his testimony and that of others.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>516</questionnumber>
      <question>Have you a copy of his testimony?</question>
      <answer>No sir, I don't know that I have here, or any where for that matter, but I heard Joseph Smith teach a great many things that never were written down.</answer>

  <questionnumber>520</questionnumber>
      <question>Well did he tach it to you in 1842, - did you hear of it in 1842 or prior to that time?</question>
      <answer>Well I can't say as to dates. I cannot state as to dates, with regard to these things, and in a great many of them I am at sea when you come to talk of dates, for I am a man who has written all these things down, - that is all the material points in my career I have written down. I have kept a journal or history of my life, and I have lived by my pen for a great many years, and have trusted to it to record these things, and when it comes to memory, I can't swear postively to any of those things you know for that reason.</answer>

  <questionnumber>526</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you say that he taught it to individuals in 1841 or 1842 either?</question>
      <answer>No sir. I cannot give you the dates.</answer>

      <question>Well not is it not a fact that you know he did not Mr. Woodruf?</question>

      <question>You cannot tell when it was, or the date when it was that Joseph Smith taught this doctrine of plural marriage to individuals, the patriarchaial order of marriage as you called it?</question>

  <questionnumber>536</questionnumber>
      <question>Or was any other elder in the church preaching it privately to them, to you knowledge?</question>
      <answer>There was no one teaching it only under his direction. He taught the principle to certain individuals, but as to the date she did these things I haven't it now to my mind.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>537</questionnumber>
      <question>You say he taught it to individiuals?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, he taught it to individuals privately. He taught it to individuals and he had quite a number of women sealed or married to him, and they, or some of them are living in this city to-day, and they were others that have died.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>538</questionnumber>
      <question>Did you ever see any women sealed to him?</question>

  <questionnumber>540</questionnumber>
      <question>Then Mr Woodruf how do you know there were any women sealed to him?</question>
      <answer>From testimony to that effect.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>541</questionnumber>
      <question>Were you present?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>542</questionnumber>
      <question>Then why do you testify when we are asking you for your own knowledhe, and not for what you heard, we are asking you about this matter for the purpose of eliciting what you know of your own knowledge, and not for hearsay testimony as to what others have told you, or what you have heard?</question>
      <answer>Well there is no doubt about that, for I have heard him time and again teach the principles of the patriarchial order of marriage.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>543</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now to refresh your recollection and to show that there was nothing of that king taught in 1842 I will read to you a certain article to which I find your hand attached?</question>

  <questionnumber>547</questionnumber>
      <question>This is the letter which I read to Mrs Young, - Please look at that book Mr Woodruf and say whether or not that is a copy of the Times and Seasons published at Nauvoo at the time this purports to have been published?</question>
      <answer>Well of course you know that when I see the Times and Season I suppose it would be a copy. Yes sir I think that is it. We published it there at time of his death, and I suppose that is it, - yes sir I suppose that is the same book.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>548</questionnumber>
      <question>Well sir that is it, and it is one of the original books too just as it was issued, - it has never been to the binder even?</question>

      </pagenumber>
      
  <questionnumber>551</questionnumber>
      <question>You never did acknowledge it up to that time?</question>
      <answer>No sir, nor at any other time up to the death of the prophet. It was called spiritual wife business, and it was got up by Bennett, and it was nothing that was acknowledged by Joseph Smith at all, or by the church. That was an invention of Bennett's that was not acknowledged or countenenced either by the church or Joseph Smith.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>552</questionnumber>
      <question>You signed that manifesto?</question>

      <question>Yes sir?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>554</questionnumber>
      <question>Now you say that this spiritual wife business was something that was concocted and gotten up by John C. Bennett, and that it was no acknowledged either by Joseph Smith or the church?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>555</questionnumber>
      <question>Was there any other rule acknowledged by the church?</question>
      <answer>Nothing that was made public, and I don't know that at that time I was fully made acquainted with it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>556</questionnumber>
      <question>If there had been any other rule in the church relative to the matter of marriage, other than that set forth in the bank of doctrine and covenants of the 1835 edition, you were not familiar or acquainted with it, or you would not have signed that letter?</question>
      <answer>No of course I did not know of any at that time, and if I had I do not know of it now.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>557</questionnumber>
      <question>Now here is another certificate that I want to call your attention to, following the one I have just read on the same page, and in the same column. It is as follows, - "We the undersigned members of the ladies relief society and married females do certify and declare that we know of no system of marriage being practiced in the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, save the one contained in the book of doctrine and covenants, and we give this certificate to the public to show that J.C. Bennet's secret wife system, "is a disclosure of his own make". That is signed by the following persons, - Emma Smith, President . Elizabeth Whitney, Counselor. Sarah M. Cleveland, Counsellor. Eliza R. Snow, Secretary. Mary C. Miller, Louis Cutler, Thirza Cahoon, Ann Hunter, Jane Law, Sopia R. Marks, Polly Z. Johnson, Abigal Works, Catherine Petty, Sarah Highbee, Phebe Woodruf, Lenora Taylor, Sara Hillman, Rosanna Marks, and Angeline Robinson".</question>

      <question>Who was the wife of Joseph Smith the president of the church?</question>

  <questionnumber>560</questionnumber>
      <question>And she was also the President of the society?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>561</questionnumber>
      <question>And Elizabeth Ann Whitney, who was the wife of N.K. Whitney was she not?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, I think so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>562</questionnumber>
      <question>And Sara M. Cleveland, a counsellor to the president of the Society?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, so it states there.</answer>

      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>564</questionnumber>
      <question>You knew all these ladies whose names I have read here, did you not?</question>
      <answer>I believe so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>565</questionnumber>
      <question>Now could any such an order of marriage have existed in the church at that time without the knowledge of the men who signed the certificate to which I called your attention a little while ago, or of the ladies who signed the certificate I have last read, and whose names I also read to you?</question>
      <answer>What is that?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>566</questionnumber>
      <question>
        I say could any order or rule or practice of marriage have existed in the church different from the rule or order prescribed in the book of doctrine and covenants at that time different

        </pagenumber>in any respect from the rules laid down in the book of doctrine and covenants at that time in force or use, which was the edition of 1835 I believe, without the knowledge of the men and women who signed these certificates?
      </question>
      <answer>Not publicly these could not have been.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>567</questionnumber>
      <question>Could there have been privately?</question>
      <answer>There might have been privately.</answer>

      <question>To their knowledge?</question>
      <answer>NO sir, not to their knowledge.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>569</questionnumber>
      <question>Then you say that up to the first day of October 1842, there was no such a system taugh or practiced openly, or secretly to your knowledge?</question>
      <answer>No sir. Not to my knowledge up to that time. 570 (Written as 670)</answer>
      <question>Then when you say in your direct examination that Joseph Smith taught and practiced it in 1842, ?</question>
      <answer>Did I say 1841 (???). If I said that I did not intend to say it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>571</questionnumber>
      <question>If you said that you meant a date subsequent to this time to the time of these certificates?</question>
      <answer>Well as to dates I say it goes at a date subsequent to his death, - that is at a date subsequent to the death of Joseph Smith, but as to the exact dates as I have stated before I cannot say.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>572</questionnumber>
      <question>Did you not say you heard him teach it?</question>
      <answer>Well I did hear him teach. He certainly taught it before his death.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>573</questionnumber>
      <question>There did you hear him teach it?</question>
      <answer>I heard him teach it, - he taught it to the quorom of twelve apostles, and he taught it to other individuals as they bear testimony. I know he taught it to us but of course, -</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>574</questionnumber>
      <question>Now what time did he teach it to the twelve apostles, - what is the first date that you can fix Mr Woodruf, if you can fix any date, - that he taught it to them?</question>
      <answer>Well he taught it to members of the twelve personally according to their testimony.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>575</questionnumber>
      <question>Well I am not asking you for their testimony Mr Woodruf, - I am asking you for your own personal knowledge?</question>
      <answer>Well it was in 1844 that he taught me and others. I know he taught me and of course as to the rest I have the testimony of others for that, but that of course I do not know of my own knowledge, but they were reliable truthful men and and what they told me was the fact beyond doubt.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>576</questionnumber>
      <question>What have you by which you can fix the date as being in 1844?</question>
      <answer>Well in his address to the quorom of twelve apostles, when he visited us, he would teach that.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>577</questionnumber>
      <question>How often would that occur?</question>
      <answer>Oh frequently for we were with him, - I don't know how many months, - but probably as much as six months, - of course I cannot tell the dates without referring to certain records, but it was nearly six months, and he spoke of it frequently. I could tell the dates by reference to certain records I have, but from memory I cannot.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>578</questionnumber>
      <question>Were these addresses he delivered to the quorom published?</question>

  <questionnumber>580</questionnumber>
      <question>Was Joseph Smith at that time teaching the quorom on the order of patriarchial marriage?</question>
      <answer>Well he taught it to us as a principle amongst other things.</answer>

        </pagenumber>same principle that Brigham practiced or taught afterwards. Is that what you want to know?
      </answer>
      
  <questionnumber>583</questionnumber>
      <question>Yes sir?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, it was the same.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>584</questionnumber>
      <question>What was that?</question>
      <answer>It was what was termed the Abramhamic principle of marriage, or the patriarchial system of marriage.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>585</questionnumber>
      <question>Did Abraham practice the plural order of marriage?</question>
      <answer>Well I was not with him, and I do not know.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>586</questionnumber>
      <question>Well from the teachings of the bible what do you say as to that?</question>
      <answer>I consider it so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>587</questionnumber>
      <question>Did he have more wives than one?</question>
      <answer>I think he did.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>588</questionnumber>
      <question>You think he did?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>589</questionnumber>
      <question>Can you name them?</question>
      <answer>Well I think that it is represented there that Hagar was his wife, and that Sarah was also his wife, - Sarah was his wife first and then he took Hagar.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>590</questionnumber>
      <question>Are you willing to swear that it is represented in the bible that Hagar was Abraham's wife?</question>
      <answer>I think that is the way it is represented.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>591</questionnumber>
      <question>Are you willing to swear that in any place in the bibble it is represented that Hagar was the wife of Abraham, - whether it is so stated in the bible in any place?</question>
      <answer>Well my view of it is that she was his wife, - that she belonged to him as his wife, and we know that he had posterity by her. He had a some by her, and you can call it what you please.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>592</questionnumber>
      <question>Well my question is what does the bible call it Mr Woodruf?</question>
      <answer>I don't recollect.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>593</questionnumber>
      <question>Don't it call her the bond woman?</question>
      <answer>It might, and probably does call her that.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>594</questionnumber>
      <question>is that what you mean by a wife?</question>
      <answer>Well I consider that if a man has a woman married to him, that she is his wife, and you can call it a bond woman or what you please, - but I consider that if she lives with him in the relation of a wife, and he has posterity by her that she is his wife, it matters not what her previous condition of servitude or other condition may have been. Now that would be my view of it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>595</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you think he was married to Hagar rightly?</question>
      <answer>Well rightly or not I could not say. It is not for me to pass on that, anything I might say would merely be my opinion, but I will say that that Abraham was a good man, and he would hardly take her without he had a right to her, or liberty from the Lord to take her.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>596</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now is it not a fact that all the right he had to her, and all the marriage ceremony there was, was simply and solely the giving of Gagar to Abraham by his wife Sarah?</question>
      <answer>What was the patriarchial order of marriage and I do not know what the ceremony was, for there is not much published about it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>597</questionnumber>
      <question>Does the bible not teach that Sarah called it wrong after the, - after she done it, - does not the bible teach that she repented and thought she had done wrong?</question>
      <answer>Well it seems that Sarah had her convictions about it, and was, or had some trouble apparently in regard to the matter. That is what I gather from my reading in regard to that transaction.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>598</questionnumber>
      <question>Well let me refresh your recollection by reading the firth verse of the sixteenth chapter of Genesis, - "And Sarah said unto Abraham, my wrong be upon thee; I have given my maid unto they bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; the Lord judge between me and thee". You recognize that as coming from the bible?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, from the reading of it I should say it was. I think I have read that myself.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>599</questionnumber>
      <question>
        Now I will read to you the twelth verse of the twenty first

        </pagenumber>chapter of Genesis, - "And God said unto Abraham, let it not be grievous in they sight because of the lad, and because of they bond woman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall they seed be called". Do you recognize that?
      </question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>600</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you know what Sarah had said unto Abraham before that?</question>
      <answer>I would only know from the reading of the bible.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>601</questionnumber>
      <question>Well do you know from the reading of the bible what she said unto him?</question>
      <answer>No sir, I say I could tell what she said by reading the bible, but at this time, and without reading it to refresh my recollection I would not know, and could not say what it was she said to him.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>602</questionnumber>
      <question>Well don't you know that Sarah had told Abraham to cast out the bond woman?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, I think she did.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>603</questionnumber>
      <question>That was Sarah's advice to Abraham?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>604</questionnumber>
      <question>And the Lord approves it?</question>
      <answer>Perhaps so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>605</questionnumber>
      <question>Then does this teach plurality of wives in Abraham's day?</question>
      <answer>Well the principle descended from that time, and after Abraham's day they took more wives than one and it descended to us from that.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>606</questionnumber>
      <question>Did Isaac have more wives than one?, and if so give me the names of them?</question>
      <answer>Well Jacob did.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>607</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you say that Jacob was Abram's son?</question>
      <answer>No sir, not his son but the principle descended from Abraham, - that is the first we see of it, and it descended from Abram in that way.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>608</questionnumber>
      <question>Did Isaac have more than one wife?</question>
      <answer>We do not know.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>609</questionnumber>
      <question>If Isaac had more than one wife be kind enough to state who they were?</question>
      <answer>I say that Jacob had more than one wife.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>610</questionnumber>
      <question>Well was Jacob Abram's son, - the President of a church, and here saying that Jacob was Abram's son?</question>
      <answer>I did not say so sir, - I said that Jacob was Isaac's son. Jacob was Isaac's son and he was Abram's grand son.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>611</questionnumber>
      <question>Well that is different?</question>
      <answer>There was any difference at all between us on that question Mr Kelley.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>612</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now you say, - Is it not a fact that according to the bible Hagar was only a bond woman?</question>
      <answer>Well of course you have to take what the bible says on that point, and that is what it says on that subject.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>613</questionnumber>
      <question>Can you now give me that, - the name of any other wife that Abram had beside Sarai?</question>
      <answer>Well of course Hagar is the only one besides Sarai that he represented, -</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>614</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now she is represented not as a wife, but as a bond woman isn't she?</question>
      <answer>Well of course he, - she is represented as a bond woman, but then he took her as a wife, and raise posterity by her, - he raised a child by her.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>615</questionnumber>
      <question>is not Keturah called his wife?</question>
      <answer>I don't know that she is.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>616</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now is it not a fact, and true, when your attention is called to it, that Keturah was also Abram's wife?</question>
      <answer>I think so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>617</questionnumber>
      <question>Well is it not a fact according to the bible, that Keturah was Abram's wife?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, I believe it is.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>618</questionnumber>
      <question>And he married her three years after the death of Sarai? Did not he do that according to the account that is given of it in the bible?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>619</questionnumber>
      <question>Well what conclusion would you draw from that Mr Woodruf?</question>
      <answer>I would draw the conclusion that it is as it is stated there in the bible of course.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>620</questionnumber>
      <question>
        Well does it not show Mr Woodruf that Abram was not a polygamist, -

      <question>Then when Joseph Smith was teaching about the Abramhamic covenant, he could not have been teaching plurality of wives?</question>

      <question>Well what I read was paragraph twenty four, and now I will read paragraph twenty five, which is as follows, - "Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph". What do you say to that?</question>
      <answer>Well there is many matters connected with that that would have to be read and construed in connection with it.</answer>

      <answer>Yes sir, many a time.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>643</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now from the reading do you say that the Lord approved or condemned the practice of polygamy in David and Solomon.</question>
      <answer>Well he condemned these men for the course they pursued in that matter. He seems to have condemned them there, or to have condemned the course they pursued in that matter.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>644</questionnumber>
      <question>Now the twenty sixth verse is this, - "Wherefore I the Lord God will not suffere that this people shall do like unto them of old".</question>

      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

      <question>Well the sentence which I have just read is that they should have but one wife, and no concubines?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>651</questionnumber>
      <question>
        Well the next verse which is verse twenty eight on the same page and in the same chapter is, - "For I, the Lord God, delighteth in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me. Thus saith the Lord God of Hosts". I will read on the balance of the chapter, - "Wherefore the people shall keep my commandments saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes. For I will saith the Lord of Hosts raise up see unto me, I will command my people, otherwise they shall hearken ynto these things. For behold I, the Lord have seen the sorrow and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem; yea and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness and abominations of their husbands. And I will not suffer saith the Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the fair daughters of this people, - which I have led out of the land of Jerusalem shall come up unto me against the men of my people, saith the Lord of Hosts. For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my people, because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with a sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit whoredoms like them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts. And now behold my brethern, ye know that these commandments were given to our Father Lehi; wherefore ye have known them before, and ye have come under great condemnation; for ye have done these things
        <pagenumber>

        </pagenumber>have come under great condemnation; for ye have done these things which ye aught not to have done. Behold ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethern. You have broken the hears of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children because of your bad example before them, and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you. And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds". Now I have read the whole of it, and I do not think there is much consolation in it for you. Now I will ask you if more than one wife, and having concubines would be a whoredom, or whoredoms under this chapter?
      </question>
      <answer>Well I don't know about that what I would say would be my opinion merely, but as far as it goes I will say that it would be in my opinion from the way it is versed there.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>652</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now we'll go through the next paragraph or verse, - "Wherefore this people shall keep my commandments saith the Lord of Hosts or cursed be the land for their sakes". Now the thirtieth paragraph is, - "For if I will saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people, otherwise they shall hearken unto these things". Now what is meant by that?</question>
      <answer>It means that the patriarchial order of marriage was practiced among them, but if the Lord said he would raise up see unto his people he would command them to that effect.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>653</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now did the Lord at this time want to raise a righteous seed?</question>
      <answer>Probably.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>654</questionnumber>
      <question>And he commanded them to do it by one wife, did he not?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir I understand it so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>655</questionnumber>
      <question>And is that not what the book says and means, when it says that he will command them if he wants them to raise up seed.</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>656</questionnumber>
      <question>That he will command them to raise it up by one wife?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. That is my understanding of what it says there, but you must remember that Joseph Smith claimed that he was commanded by the Lord, -</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>657</questionnumber>
      <question>Well that is not answering my question. I did not ask you anything about what Joseph Smith claimed, and I move to strike the answer from the record on the ground that it is not responsive to the question asked the witness.</question>
      <answer>Well that is what he claimed, - that he had a revelation from God commanding these things.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>658</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now if I understand you correctly you said that the Times & Seasons was the church paper of the church during the term of its existence?</question>
      <answer>The church paper?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>659</questionnumber>
      <question>Yes sir?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir for a large part of the time it was published by the church, but it was not regarded and was not a revelation to the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>660</questionnumber>
      <question>Now I don't mean that, - I simply asked up if it was not published by the church?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>661</questionnumber>
      <question>And you were connected with its publication for some time?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. I was connected with the business part of it, - I looked after its temporal affairs you might say. John Taylor was its editor.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>662</questionnumber>
      <question>He was one of the twelve apostles?</question>

      <answer>Of course I suppose it is.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>668</questionnumber>
      <question>Well do you know whether it is or not?</question>
      <answer>It looks to me to be a copy of it. It looks like it. It seems to me to be a copy I have no doubt in the world but what it is a copy of the Times & Seasons.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>669</questionnumber>
      <question>I will read it to you, The saints of the last days have witnessed the outgoings and incomings of so many apostates that nothing but truth has any effect upon them. In the present instance after the sham quotations of Sidney and his clique, from the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, to skulk off under the "dreadful splendor" of "spiritual wifery" which is brought under the account as graciously as if the law of the land allowed a man a plurality of wives, is fiendish, and like the rest of Sidney's revelations just because he wanted "to go to Pittsburg and live". Woe to the man or men who will thus willfully lie to injure an innocent people. The law of the land, and the rules of the church, do not allow one man to have more than one wife alive at once, but if any man's wife die, he has the right to marry another, and to be sealed to both for eternity; to the living and the dead. There is no law of God or man against it. This is all the spiritual wife system that ever was tolerated in the church, and they know it". Now that is dated November fifteenth 1844?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>670</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you recognize that?</question>
      <answer>How is that signed up?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>671</questionnumber>
      <question>What is that?</question>
      <answer>Who signed that, is that communication signed and if so by whom?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>672</questionnumber>
      <question>Well do you recognize that?</question>
      <answer>I don't remember anything about it, but if I knew who it was signed by I could possibly. I might remember something about it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>673</questionnumber>
      <question>That is signed an "Old man of Israel".</question>
      <answer>There is no name given.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>674</questionnumber>
      <question>That is the only name that is given, "An old Man of Israel". That is the only signature?</question>
      <answer>I don't remember anything about it at all.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>675</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you remember that name, "An Old Man of Israel"?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>676</questionnumber>
      <question>You don't?</question>
      <answer>No sir I don't remember anything about it at all. There is nothing strange about that though, for there was a great deal published in that publication at that time that I was connected with that I did not know anything about. I can't at this time, fifty years after remember everything that as published in that publication.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>677</questionnumber>
      <question>I will ask you if you recollect this editorial comment by John Taylor, who was at that time one of the twelve apostles with yourself, under the head of "Union and Peace at Nauvoo", well I will not read the whole of it, for that follows has no reference to the communication of "An Old Man of Israel", but it is further down, where it is said editorially, "For the communication of an 'An Old Man of Israel', and the letter of elder Addison Pratt from the islands of the Pacific ocean, we bespeak a hearty welcome. They are genuine". Now do you recall that?</question>
      <answer>No sir, but I would like to look at that a moment.</answer>

      <question>You read the Times and Seasons at that time did you not?</question>

  <questionnumber>680</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now I will repeat my question again, and ask you if you did not read the Times and Seasons at that time?</question>
      <answer>I do not know sir". I do not know sir whether I did or not.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>681</questionnumber>
      <question>You were not connected with it at that time?</question>
      <answer>No sir that was after I left it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>682</questionnumber>
      <question>Well you were a subscriber to it?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>683</questionnumber>
      <question>And have a copy of it for that year?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, I should have but I don't know that I have postively.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>684</questionnumber>
      <question>Now this was the church paper at that time, - that is the Times and Seasons was the church paper at that time, - in that year, - 1844?</question>
      <answer>It was published by the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>685</questionnumber>
      <question>And published by an apostle in the church too, wasn't it?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, so long as John Taylor was editor of it it was.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>686</questionnumber>
      <question>Well one of the apostles in the church held the editorship of that publication from long before the time of the death of Joseph Smith up to the time that its publication was discontinued, didn't he?</question>
      <answer>Well I don't know, but I suppose it is likely that such was the case. The paper shows for itself, and I cannot answer as to that sir. I know that I left the work of the paper some time before it was discontinued. I think I left the paper some time before the death of Joseph Smith.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>687</questionnumber>
      <question>You think that you left the paper before the death of Joseph Smith, - that is the Times & Seasons?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, I think I did. I am quite postive I did, however the paper will show for itself when the time was that I left it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>688</questionnumber>
      <question>I will ask you Mr Woodruf if the doctrine about which you have been testifying, prior to this time, was not simply and solely the doctrine of sealing?</question>
      <answer>The doctrine of sealing?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>689</questionnumber>
      <question>Yes sir, and was that not the doctrine that was taught to you by Joseph Smith, and that doctrine alone?</question>
      <answer>Well you might call it sealing because all persons are or were sealed. When I took a plurality of wives they were sealed to me, so you can call it what you please.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>690</questionnumber>
      <question>Will you answer my question Mr. Woodruf?</question>
      <answer>I have tried to do so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>691</questionnumber>
      <question>No sir, you appear to be attempting to evade the answer, - I will ask you again if it is not a fact that what Joseph Smith taught was sealing, and not a plurality of wives?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>692</questionnumber>
      <question>Didn't he teach it as sealing?</question>
      <answer>No sir, - at least he did not in my hearing.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>693</questionnumber>
      <question>Did not he teach this and this only, - that if a man married and his wife died, he was entitled to take another wife, and that he could be sealed to each wife, - to the first wife for time and eternity, and the second wife for time, - is that not it, - it that not what he taught? Is that not the teaching of Joseph Smith up yo the time of his death and that only?</question>
      <answer>No sir. He taught the plurality of wives.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>694</questionnumber>
      <question>Didn't he teach this that a man could be sealed simply to his own wife?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>695</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you say it is?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. That he could be sealed simply to his own wife?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>696</questionnumber>
      <question>Yes sir?</question>
      <answer>
        I don't think it is sir. That is the doctrine that is there. That revelation of course is on the plurality of wives.

        </pagenumber>to his own wife, - his first wife, - but that did not prevent other wives from being sealed to him. There is nothing in that revelation on plural marriage that deprives a man from the right of having his wife sealed to him.

  <questionnumber>697</questionnumber>
      <question>Were you taught in Nauvoo by Joseph Smith that in order for a man to be exalted in the hereafter, that he must have more wives than one?</question>
      <answer>What is that?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>698</questionnumber>
      <question>I asked you if Joseph Smith had ever taught you at Nauvoo or any where else during his life time, that in order for a man to be exalted in the hereafter he must have more than one wife.</question>
      <answer>I don't know that I ever heard him make use of that expression, or use that form of expression.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>699</questionnumber>
      <question>Were you taught in Nauvoo or at where else by Joseph Smith at any time, that a woman could not be exalted in the hereafter unless she was married?</question>
      <answer>Unless she was married?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>700</questionnumber>
      <question>Yes sir.</question>
      <answer>No sir, I don't know that I heard him teach that doctrine particularly. There is the revelation and it speaks for itself if you wish to know what he taught. That is the revelation he taught and you can see it, - it speaks for itself.</answer>

      <question>That was the only law on the question of marriage that was in the church?</question>
      <answer>That was all the law on the question of marriage that was given to the body of the people. Of course as I have said before, and as others also have said, as I understand it, there were marriages that were performed by the prophet.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>764</questionnumber>
      <question>Now I will ask you Mr Woodruf, I will ask you why the church of which you are the President, —in the publication of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, —in the edition of 1876 for instance, —eliminated from that section, —from that book I should say, the section on marriage as found in the 1835 edition, and in all the editions of the book of doctrine and covenants published up to the 1878 edition, and inserted in lieu of that section on marriage the revelation on polygamy dated July 12th 1843?</question>

      <question>Now can you tell why the section on marriage that had always been, in the book of doctrine and covenants up to that time, or up to that date was eliminated from it, and the other inserted in lieu of it?</question>
      <answer>I cannot.</answer>

  <questionnumber>769</questionnumber>
      <question>Was it not done because one was in conflict with the other?</question>
      <answer>I don't know that I can state why it was done, but I have heard representations that the doctrine as put into the book of doctrine and covenants, —formerly the old doctrine as put into it, —that is into the book of doctrine and covenants, —by Oliver Cowdery, and was represented as being contrary to the wishes of Joseph Smith, but I couldn't swear that that was the fact.</answer>

  <questionnumber>806</questionnumber>
      <question>Well was not that baptism under the gospel Covenant?</question>
      <answer>There was nothing said about the gospel or a covenant in any of the baptisms. There has been and is of course a proper baptism for the living, and one for the dead, and when I was first baptized I was baptized for myself.</answer>

      <question>Was it a new covenant you were baptized in as spoken of in the seventh chapter of Hebrews by Paul?</question>
      <answer>There was nothing said about any covenants, - It was just the testimony of the person baptized to the effect of believing the gospel, and upon the confession of that belief the person is led into the water, and baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and Holy Ghost by one having the commission of Jesus Christ to perform baptisms, and he would emerse the one to be baptized in the water, and say "I baptize you in the name of the Father the Sone and the Holy Ghost, Amen".

  <questionnumber>812</questionnumber>
      <question>Is not the gospel the new covenant in contra-distinction to the old covenant in force under Moses, - or the Mosaic law?</question>

        </pagenumber>section forty seven of Exhibit "E", it is to be found on page one hundred and seventy eight, and the portion of the section I shall read is para graph one. The exhibit referred to as Exhibit "E" is the 1835 edition of the book of doctrine and covenants, and the revelation was given in April 1830. It is a follows, - "Behold, I say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be done away in this thing, and this is a new and everlasting covenant; even that which was from the beginning, - Therefore although a man should be baptized an hundred times, it availeth him nothing; for you cannot enter in at the straight gate by the law of Moses, neither by your dead works; for it is because of your dead works that I have caused this last covenant and this church to be built up until me; even as in days of old. Wherefore enter ye in at the gate, as I have commanded, and seek not to counsel your God, Amen." Now I have read the whole of that section for there is only one paragraph in it. Now you recognize that as teaching that the gospel covenant was the new covenant?
      </question>
      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is irrelevant and immeterial and not cross examination.</mono>
      <answer>I have no objection to answering the question, or to the law laid down there, for it is a new and everlasting cobenant, a covenant that God has made in these last days, by sending a prophet, seer and revelator who has delivered the gospel as it was in the days of Christ and the apostles, and I view that s being what is termed the covenants for the generations since the days of Paul and apostles that is referred to there.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>814</questionnumber>
      <question>Then you view this as being a new covenant?</question>

  <questionnumber>817</questionnumber>
      <question>You had not broken the covCnant into which you were originally baptized?</question>
      <answer>Not that I am aware of, but let me say that there is not commandment that I know of, nor any law that I know of which says that a man shall not be re-baptized.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>818</questionnumber>

      <answer>What is that?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>831</questionnumber>
      <question>Is not this revelation I say which has been inserted in the book of doctrine and covenants in lieu of the original revelation on marriage as it appears in the edition of 2835 of the Doctrine and covenants, - is that not called a new covenant?</question>

      <question>Is that the new covenant spoken of in section forty seven of Exhibit M, the edition of 1835 of the book of doctrine and covenants?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it does not call for the best evidence, the book itself being the best evidence, and the question calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>836</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you refer to the same thing?</question>

  <questionnumber>844</questionnumber>
      <question>This is in the 1835 edition of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and is a revelation given in April 1830, as I before stated I will read it to you again, "Behold I say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be done away in this thing, and this is a new and everlasting covenant; even that which was from the beginning, Wherefore, although a man should be baptized an hundred times, it availeth them nothing, for you cannot enter in at the straight gate by the law of Moses, neither by your dead works; for ir is because of your dead works, that I have caused this last covenant, and this church to be built up unto me; even as in days of old. Wherefore enter ye in at the gate as I have commanded, and seek not to counsel your God, Amen". What do you say to that?</question>
      <answer>I have said or if I have not, I will say it now, it don't make any difference how many times a man is baptized, if it is not done by authority from God, for there is no man that ever breathed the breath of life from Father Adam down to today, who had power to go forth and baptize the children of men except by the authority of God.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>845</questionnumber>
      <question>You were baptized by legal authority in 1835?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>846</questionnumber>
      <question>Then why the necessity of being rebaptized in 1849 or 1850?</question>
      <answer>I do not say there was any necessity. I could not say there was any necessity. We simply wanted to renew our covenants, and none of us had killed anybody or committed adultery or stole anything or broken any law that I knew of, but we simply felt that we wanted to renew our covenants. Not that was the way it was, and as I have already stated I was not an am not now aware of any law that prohibited us from being rebaptized if we saw for to be rebaptized.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>847</questionnumber>
      <question>This revelation I have read given in 1830, was the new and everlasting law, the new and everlasting covenant I should say?</question>
      <answer>Well that was the covenant that was established in the organization of this church, and which revealed the priesthood to the children of men,</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>848</questionnumber>
      <question>You understand it was a new and everlasting covenant?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. It was a new covenant in the last days, because it referred to the establishing of the church and the priesthood.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>849</questionnumber>
      <question>Well what I am asking you about Mr. President is whether it was the new and everlasting covenant in 1830 when it was given?</question>
      <answer>Well I view it so, and there is a reason for it of course.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>850</questionnumber>
      <question>Well if it was the new and everlasting covenant, how could it be that it was not revealed until thirteen years after that time and then called the new and everlasting covenant?</question>
      <answer>Well that is called a new and everlasting covenant in that case because of the law of marriage under which it was given. That is as I view it but of course I do not know, but that is my opinion.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>851</questionnumber>
      <question>Well it is not the covenant that is spoken of in the other?</question>
      <answer>Well I don't know whether it is or not, but I should judge it is not.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>852</questionnumber>
      <question>But the other had already been revealed in 1830?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, and there is a reason given for it, and why. There is a covenant, a revelation perhaps that is not considered in the other.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>853</questionnumber>
      <question>And for that reason you were rebaptized when you came to Salt Lake is that not true?</question>
      <answer>No sir, not at all, not with regard to that covenant.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>854</questionnumber>
      <question>Then why were you rebaptized?</question>
      <answer>
        As I said before we were rebaptized because we felt like doing it, renewing our covenant before the Lord. It was not done because we felt that we had to do it, but because we felt disposed to do so, simply because we felt disposed to go and do it.

      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to each and every question asked the witness relating to the hew and everlasting covenant, on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper cross examination and moves the court to strike from the record all the testimony bearing on that question for the reasons given above.</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>855</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now I will read from section sixty five, paragraph two, page one hundred and ninety one of the 1835 edition of the book of doctrine and covenants. I will read all of paragraph two, as follows, - "And they have done unto the son of man even as they listed and he has taken his power on the right hand of his glory, and now reigheith in the heavens and will reign till he descends on the earth to put all enemies under his feet; which time is nigh at hand; I the Lord God have spoken it; but the hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes; where fore I will that all men shall repent, for all are under sin, except them which I reserved unto myself, hold men, that ye know not of; where-fore I say unto you that I have sent unto you mine everlasting covenant, even that which was from the beginning, and that which I have promised I have so fulfilled, and the nations of the earth shall bow it to, and if not of themselves they shall come down, for that which is now exalted of itself shall be laid low of power; wherefore I give unto you a commandment, that ye go among the people and say unto them like unto mine apostles of old, whose name was Peter; believe on the name of the Lord Jesus, who was on earth, and is to come the beginning and the end; repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, according to the holy commandment, for the remission of sins; and who so doeth this, shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of the hands of the elders of this church. Now that is from a revelation given to Sidney Rigdon, Parley Pratt, and Lemon Copley, given March 1831?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is irrelevant and immeterial an not cross examination.</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>856</questionnumber>
      <question>What does that section indicate? That section shows that the everlasting covenant was revealed in 1831 does it not?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
      <mono>By Mr Cabell, - "We object on behalf of the defendent to the question ashed the witness on the further ground that it calls for an opinion of the witness, when the witness is here to state the facts, and not give his opinions". By Mr P.P. Kelley, -</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>857</questionnumber>
      <question>Well Mr President, as a fact, I will ask you if that revelation doe snot show that the ever lasting covenant was not revealed prior to 1831?</question>
      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons that it is irrelevant an immeterial, not cross examination and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
      <answer>I am willing to answer the gentlemen if he wishes me to do so. That amount of it is that the new and everlasting covenant that was from the beginning and will always be, is a covenant that the God of heaven made in the early days with the early priesthood, and any man that reveiced the gospel, received the gospel with that priesthood, and it is an eternal covenant descending from one generation to another, and will continue as long as the Lord has a priesthood on earth, and whatever covenant they have in that other revelation I have nothing to say about it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>858</questionnumber>
      <question>
        Have you any other new and everlasting covenant, outside of that spoken in section sixty five which I have read to you?

      <question>Do you decline to answer the question?</question>
      <answer>Well with regard to what he said in that covenant on the patriarchal order of marriage, it is a covenant connected with the law of marriage as represented in the first covenant.</answer>

      <question>Is it the same one as is referred to in the 1835 edition of the book of Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
      <answer>I have nothing to say about it. There is the word of the Lord, and I am not going to contradict it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>864</questionnumber>
      <question>You say you do not feel disposed to contradict the word of the Lord?</question>
      <answer>No sir, I would not be presumptuous enough to do that.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>865</questionnumber>
      <question>Then if this is a contradiction, then if that is a new one it is a change of the one spoken of in section sixty five of the 1835 edition of the book of covenants?</question>

      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, not cross examination and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>866</questionnumber>
      <question>Is it not? There must be a change in there too, must there not?</question>
      <answer>If you knew everything that is meant in that law, or by that law, and what the Lord meant by it, you could answer it, and so could I, but I don't, and I do not think you do either, nor do I think that any man does so that he can explain it. Of course it is a different principle, and of course it is connected there with the new and everlasting covenant.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>867</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now when there was a change in the law there aught to be a change in the priesthood shouldn't there? In the new testament that is taught. It is taught in the Hebrew letter is it not?</question>
      <answer>Well all I will say is that if it is in there it is correct.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>868</questionnumber>
      <question>Well if that is true, if it is true that there is a change in the law, there must of necessity be a change in the priesthood must there not?</question>
      <answer>How is that?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>869</questionnumber>
      <question>I say if there is a change in the law there must of necessity be a change in the priesthood? Is that not true?</question>
      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is irrelevant and immaterial, not cross examination and calling for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
      <answer>I don't know, that is if it is a law from God. I don't know. If you have a priesthood from man and a priesthood from God, of course there is a change.</answer>

      <question>Now I want to read the sixth paragraph of this section--section one hundred and thirty-two, in the book introduced as exhibit A by the defendants. It is on page four hundred and sixty four, it is as follows: "And as pertaining to the new and everlating covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth the fulness therof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God." I will also read the seventh verse of the same section: "And verily, I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are these -- all covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations that are not made and entered into, and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise of him who is anointed, both as well for time and eternity, and that too, most holy by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine annointed, whom I have appointed to hold this power, (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of the priesthood are conferred) are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead." Now, does this abolish the new covenant that was referred to in the revelations of 1831?</question>
      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons that it is imcompetent, irrevlevant, and immaterial, not cross examination, and calling for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
      <answer>Well, there is three glories, celestial, terrestrial, and telestial. These are the three glories, and this is also in the revelations of God in the last days, and whatever is said in that new and everlasting covenant belongs to the celetial glories, when you come to explain it, and if you could understand these things of course there would be no mystery connected with it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>873</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now, was the new and everlating covenant referred to in the revelation of 1831 able to raise them to the celestial, or highest glory?</question>
      <answer>Probably, and it would be understood if all the law of God was there.</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons as set forth in the last objection, and moves the court to strike out the answer of the witness on the same grounds.</mono>

      <question>Does not the section I have read to you, Mr. Woodruff, teach that all the contracts entered into by parties who are not obligated or do not believe in the section I have read to you, upon their death end--marriage contracts as well as all others?</question>
      <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>879</questionnumber>
      <question>And that was in 1847 you say, - that is the time when Brigham Young was selected or elected to the Presidency of the Church?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. It was either late in 1847 or the spring of 1848. I think however it was in 1847, but I could not say postively, for I can't remember the dates.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>880</questionnumber>
      <question>What was his position prior to that time, - that is the position that Brigham Young occupied in the church prior to that time?</question>

  <questionnumber>881</questionnumber>
      <question>How many of the twelve apostles united their fortunes with the church that came west?</question>
      <answer>There was all that was in the church I believe but William Smith. I think that William Smith was east at the time of the migration from Nauvoo.</answer>

      <answer>I think not.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>885</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you say he was not one of the twelve apostles at the time?</question>
      <answer>I said I thought he was not, but I would not say postively as to that, for I might be mistaken about that.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>886</questionnumber>
      <question>Was not Lyman Wight a member of the twelve at that time?</question>
      <answer>Well I don't know. Those are all matters you know that in our travels up here, - well I could not answer these questions unless I had time to look the matters up. If I had time to look over papers and books I could tell you a good deal more about these things, but I cannot do so unless I do that. I cannot remember as an independant act of my memory with sufficient accuracy to state these facts as positive facts, but I think that Lyman Wight was in the church at the time we were there. We came here in 1847 first, and this conference at which Brigham Young was elected President was held on our return from here as pioneers, and I think it was held at winter quarters.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>887</questionnumber>
      <question>Did you have more than nine of the twelve apostles there at that conference at which Brigham Young was selected as the President of the church?</question>
      <answer>I could not say.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>888</questionnumber>
      <question>Well do you know?</question>
      <answer>I do not know whether there was nine apostles or more than that number there or not.</answer>

      <question>Well now don't you know that at the time you were there in win-quarters you only had nine apostles present with you, and that Lyman Wight, John E. Page and William Smith were the other three?</question>
      <answer>Well sir I do not know. I don't know from memory, - whether they were in the church at that time I could not say, for my memory on these things is not as good as it might be therefore I cannot remember. My memory does not serve me to answer that question postively.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>890</questionnumber>
      <question>You do not say that there was any more than that nine there do you?</question>
      <answer>No sir, I can't say how many were there, and to do so I would have to look that matter up.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>891</questionnumber>
      <question>Can you give the names of the ones that were there?</question>

      <question>Was John E. Page there?</question>
      <answer>No sir. Neither John E. Page, William B. Smith or Lyman Wight were there, and they were afterwards cut off from the church I believe, - I think it was afterwards, - but at all events they were cut off from the church. I do not know from memory that they were not there at that time, but it is my recollection that they were not there.</answer>

      <question>Did you say that they were cut off from the church?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. John E. Page withdrew from the church, and took a company with him, the same as Strang and others did.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>902</questionnumber>
      <question>They were not cut off from the church but withdrew on account of the practice of polygamy, - is that not the fact Mr. Woodruf?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>903</questionnumber>
      <question>They did not?</question>
      <answer>No sir, they did not, for William Smith practiced polygamy himself.</answer>

      <question>Well are you willing to swear that he practiced it, - swear to it of your own knowledge?</question>
      <answer>Well I could not swear to it in that way but I believe it to be a fact and you will have testimony produced here before you are through with this matter. There is no doubt about it, for I have known several women who were his wives, at least they said they were, and I believe it for I know, or did at that time know something of his circumstances.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>908</questionnumber>
      <question>Well you can't know that of your own knowledge?</question>
      <answer>Well I never saw a woman sealed to him. I never saw that, but you know a man can know many a thing and give testimony to it, and know it is true that he did not see, - that he does not absolutely know personally.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>909</questionnumber>
      <question>Well now at the time of the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, did not the authority for the office of the Presidency, - did not the authority of the church fall upon the twelve apostles?</question>

      <question>And are they leading it now?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>924</questionnumber>
      <question>Are the twelve still leading in Joseph's place?</question>
      <answer>No sir. The twelve governed and controlled the church until the organization of the first Presidency, and upon the organization of the first Presidency the authority became vested in it. That was the method that was pursoed then and has been since that time.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>925</questionnumber>
      <question>Well what is it?</question>
      <answer>That when the President is dead or passes away, it devolves on the twelve apostles to govern the church until such time as another President can be elected. That is the method that has been pursued.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>926</questionnumber>
      <question>Where did you get that authority to act in that manner?</question>
      <answer>From Joseph Smith, at the very last interview we had with him. He gave that authority in the lats interview that was had with him, in the world.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>927</questionnumber>
      <question>Well what did he say when he gave that authority?</question>
      <answer>Well he said he was soon going away, and he said "God Almighty has revealed until me, and sealed unto me every authority and power and key belonging to this dispensation, that he ever gave to any man upon earth, and I have sealed these powers and principles upon your heads as the servants of the twelve apostles", and he went on and said, "now you have to round up your shoulders, and bear off this kingdom, and if you don't do it you will be damned". Now that is substantially what he said, and about as much authority as we had. And I think the Spirit of the Lord has manifested himself in the church since that time.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>928</questionnumber>
      <question>And that was the way that was done?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>929</questionnumber>
      <question>That is the manner in which the authority was conferred upon the twelve?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>930</questionnumber>
      <question>Now did he confer that authority upon nay single individual?</question>
      <answer>No sir, it was upon the twelve apostles.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>931</questionnumber>
      <question>And they were to bear the burden?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. He has taught us the order of the priesthood, and given us to understand all the revelations.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>932</questionnumber>
      <question>Did he appoint any one of the twelve to receive revelations and act as the President of the church?</question>

      <answer>President Brigham Young was the President of the twelve apostles, and upon his shoulders rested this power, and of course he was ordained by Joseph by virtue of the Holy authority of the Church of God, and he was in due time chosen by the church as its President.</answer>

  <questionnumber>939</questionnumber>
      <question>Did he while Joseph Smith lived?</question>
      <answer>No sir. Not while he lived. That is he occupied that position when he was first ordained into the quorum of twelve. He was the oldest man, and occupied that position as long as he remained faithful in it.</answer>

      <answer>I have answered the question.</answer>

      <question>Don't you know that the revelation so states the fact,-that he held all the keys while he was Presiden of the twelve?</question>

      <answer>He did not take that distinction that I know of at that time as applying to any one there.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>947</questionnumber>
      <question>Did he at any time?</question>
      <answer>Only as we gather from his teachings, and he always taught that the President or Oldest man in the quorum of twelve would be the President of the quorum of twelve, and in the absence of the first Presidency of the church or the President of the church they were the next in authority and were to preside over the church; and you will find that in all the revelations as well as the books of the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>948</questionnumber>
      <question>What books?</question>
      <answer>The book of doctrine and covenants, the book of Mormon and the bible.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>949</questionnumber>
      <question>You said it was in the revelation of the church?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>950</questionnumber>
      <question>Please mention one revelation in which we find that doctrine?</question>
      <answer>What is that? 951 I asked you to mention one revelation in which we can find that doctrine,-the doctrine that in the absence of the President the President of the quorum of the twelve is to exercise authority in the church?</answer>
      <answer>Well I can't point it out to you unless I have time to search it out.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>952</questionnumber>
      <question>Well sir I will give you from this time until to-morrow at noon,-from the time you get off the witness stand until to-morrow afternoon when we meet here to do so. Will you agree after you leave the witness stand to find it and come back here tomorrow at,-well at the time we convene here, and present that revelation?</question>
      <answer>I don't think it will take that long sir. If you will take book of doctrine and Covenants, and turn to the organization of the church, and if it is published there, as I think it still is, you will find it,-the twelve apostles were equal in authority with the first Presidency of the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>953</questionnumber>
      <question>Well that is not the question?</question>
      <answer>
        It is the question of showing that the President of the quorum of twelve would be the President of the quorum of twelve would be the President of the church in the event of

        </pagenumber>the President of the church dying?
      </answer>
      <answer>Well sir you read the revelation there on the organization of the church and you will see it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>955</questionnumber>
      <question>Will you be kind enough to point out the revelation in any book of doctrine and covenants printed since the year 1830, on which it is taught that the President of the Quorom of Twelve, would become the President of the church, - would succeed to the office of the First Presidency of the church, upon the death of the First President?</question>
      <answer>There has been a great many revelations given since 1830.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>956</questionnumber>
      <question>I know that, but I simply ask you to point to one of them which says that upon the death of the President of the church, the right to the succession to the office devolves upon the President of the Quorom of Twelve. I will give you from the beginning of the year 1844 up to the very time of the death of Joseph Smith on the 27th day of June 1844, - I mean from the first of the year of 1830 up to the very day of the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, to produce a revelation to that effect, either from any of the books of doctrine and Covenants published during that period, or which have been published since that time, that advance such a doctrine or rule as that? I will give you full latitude you see to do so if you can?</question>
      <answer>Well I say any body can turn to the revelation on the organization of the church and see for themselves what the revelation says.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>957</questionnumber>
      <question>Well I have never been able to find the one you refer to, and I have never been able to find any one who did, therefore I ask you for the information as to where it can be found? How do you say Mr Woodruf that there is any such a revelation in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, given to Joseph Smith, or to any body else, between 1830 and 1844, - the 27th day of June 1844, - down to that date, that teaches that upon the death of the President of the church, that the President of the twelve apostles succeeds to the Presidency of the church. Now sir that is the question I ask you and if you have ever seen such a revelation I would like you to state where it can be found, giving me the book and the page?</question>
      <answer>Well you will find it in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, if you will give me the one on the, - (witness hereupon takes a book). Here it is, - section one hundred and seven on page three hundred and eighty three in this book of doctrine and covenants.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>958</questionnumber>
      <question>What is the date of it?</question>
      <answer>1835, - that is the date of the revelation.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>959</questionnumber>
      <question>What time in 1835?</question>
      <answer>The date of the revelation is March 28th 1835. Now in speaking of the organization of the church it says, - it states in order, the order of the high priesthood of the church, and states what it is and whom it rests upon.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>960</questionnumber>
      <question>Well go on and read the part of the revelation that says that the President of the twelve apostles shall be the President of the church?</question>
      <answer>It don't say that?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>961</questionnumber>
      <question>It does not state that?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>962</questionnumber>
      <question>Well I thought not?</question>
      <answer>Well but it says, -</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>963</questionnumber>
      <question>
        Well now never mind, - you have answered my question Mr Woodruf and that is sufficient. Well now is there in that book or any other book of doctrine and Covenants published between 1830 and the 27th day of June 1844, - one word in that revelation or any other revelation which says that in case the President of the church dies the Presidency shall descend to the President of the council of twelve? If there is I will give you time to find it for I am

        </pagenumber>curious to know if it is there, and if you will undertake to find it you can have your own time to do so Mr Woodruf?
      </question>
      <answer>Well if you can find anything else than that in the order of these revelations as they are given in this book than that I don't understand the question, that is all. I cannot see what else they mean, although they do not come out and state the fact as you state it in your question. It states here that the twelve shall have equal authority with the President of the church, and I cannot see what else that means other than that is the event of the death of the President the Presiding officer of that quorom shall have authority when confirmed by the church, to act in his place. It says, - "The presiding high priest, chosen by the body and ordained to that office, and upheld by the faith, confidence and prayer, etc." Now that is what that says, and when the President dies some body has bot to lead the church, and there is no one that I can see to do it but the presiding officer of the highest quorom of the church. For it is evident that when the President dies somebody has to lead the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>964</questionnumber>
      <question>Well I will admit that?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, that cannot be denied.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>965</questionnumber>
      <question>Well but was not the authority conferred by Joseph Smith, upon the whole twelve to lead the church?</question>
      <answer>Well they are to be appointed, - the three Presidents from the twelve apostles, and they were to be upheld and sustained by the authority of the people. They have always done that upon the death of every President the church has ever had. I don't know of any other authority higher or plainer than that sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>966</questionnumber>
      <question>The twelve are simply the second quorom in authority are they not, - they are not the highest quorom in authority in the church?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, - there is the quorom on the Presidency.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>967</questionnumber>
      <question>The twelve then are the second quorom in authority?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>968</questionnumber>
      <question>And that is the quorom you referred to is it not?</question>
      <answer>In what way?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>969</questionnumber>
      <question>That is the quorom the revelation you have referred, - or read referred to, is it not?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. It is the second quorom when the Presidency is living, but when the presidency dies, it becomes as a matter of necessity the first quorom.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>970</questionnumber>
      <question>The first Presidency has to be called by revelation does it not?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>971</questionnumber>
      <question>Always?</question>
      <answer>The first Presidency is called by revelation.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>972</questionnumber>
      <question>Would it be the first Presidency unless it was called by revelation?</question>
      <answer>Well you can read that revelation for yourself and see what it says. What you are asking for now is simply my opinion and that I presume would not be competent.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>973</questionnumber>
      <question>Well I want your opinion as to that, - you are the President of the church, and presumably were called in that way, therefore your opinion might be of weight?</question>
      <answer>They are equal in authority to the first Presidency, and when the first Presidency dies there is no revelation given to any other quorom, the authority to lead the church but them.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>974</questionnumber>
      <question>
        I will read you from section fourteen, in exhibit E, page on hundred and twenty five, revelation given February 1831, the first and second paragraphs, - "Oh hearken ye elders of my church, and give ear to the words which I shall speak unto you; for behold verily, verily I say unto you that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you, to receive commandments and revelations from my hand. And this ye shall know assuredly that there is none other appointed unto you to receive commandments

But verily, verily, I say unto you that none else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be through him, for if it be taken from him he shall not have power, except to appoint another in his stead ; and this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come before you as revelations or commandments; that you may not be deceived; that you may know they are not of me. For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you, before, to teach those revelations which you received, and shall receive through him whom I have appointed". What do you say to that?
      </question>
      <answer>Well the twelve apostles ware called and ordained by the direction of Joseph Smith and under his hand, and the President of the twelve apostles was ordained to that position.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>975</questionnumber>
      <question>Were they all appointed as Presidents by Joseph Smith?</question>
      <answer>As Presidents?</answer>

  <questionnumber>978</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you know that they were not?</question>
      <answer>I know that they were appointed as apostles or members of the quorum of twelve.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>979</questionnumber>
      <question>Were they all appointed prophets, seers and revelators by Joseph Smith?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

      <answer>I do.</answer>

      <answer>Yes sir, he called them all.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>983</questionnumber>
      <question>To receive revelations for the church?</question>
      <answer>The entire number of the apostles, -the twelve apostles, were sealed, -had these gifts sealed upon them by Joseph Smith before his death.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>984</questionnumber>
      <question>What gifts?</question>
      <answer>The gifts as prophets, seers and revelators.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>985</questionnumber>
      <question>Were they to receive revelations for the church?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>986</questionnumber>
      <question>They were endowed or authorized to receive revelations for the church?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir. in their time.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>987</questionnumber>
      <question>The same as in stated in this revelation I have just read?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>988</questionnumber>
      <question>You said they were authorized to receive revelations in their time? What did yon mean by that?</question>
      <answer>When they were called upon or would be called upon to govern the church, they were then to receive revelations, but they had a right to receive revelations themselves at any time, the same as any other member of the church. The power to receive revelations to be an authority and rule on the church was conferred upon them in the event of their being called to the Presidency of the church.</answer>

      <answer>What purpose?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>990</questionnumber>
      <question>To receive revelations for the church?</question>
      <answer>I have not said that. I did not state that he was to set any one apart for that purpose. The whole twelve were set apart for that purpose by Joseph.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>991</questionnumber>
      <question>Well did he set any one apart individually?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>992</questionnumber>
      <question>He did not set any one particular person apart for that purpose?</question>
      <answer>No sir, not individually in that respect.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>993</questionnumber>
      <question>Did he not set a part the seventy two?</question>
      <answer>No sir not in that capacity. Of course the seventy were ordained in the position they occupied but the same gifts were not conferred upon them that were conferred upon the twelve to be exercised in the event of a certain contingency arising.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>994</questionnumber>
      <question>What was that contingency?</question>
      <answer>In the event of their being called to the Presidency of the church.</answer>

  <questionnumber>995</questionnumber>
      <question>You say the quorom of seventy was ordained?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, all the authorities in the church were ordained.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>996</questionnumber>
      <question>Now did he not set them apart as a third quorom in the church?</question>
      <answer>No sir, I don't think he did, - that is the twelve apostles, -</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>997</questionnumber>
      <question>Are you willing to swear that he did not?</question>
      <answer>No sir I am not willing to sear he did not but there is a difference in those quoroms.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>998</questionnumber>
      <question>Were or are they recognized in the revelation as the third quorom in the church?</question>
      <answer>I don't know. There is the high priests and the seventies, - and of course it is an office of the high priesthood.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>999</questionnumber>
      <question>Were they not recognized as holding the same authority as the twelve?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1000</questionnumber>
      <question>An equal authority?</question>
      <answer>No sir. There were seventy in their decisions.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1001</questionnumber>
      <question>The seventys have equal authority with the twelve? Is that what you say?</question>
      <answer>If they all agree upon any point they have the same authority, - that is they have equal authority with the twelve in any decision on a question that is submitted to them, but they cannot control the twelve in any way, nor the President of the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1002</questionnumber>
      <question>They have equal authority when they all agree?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, upon any given question.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1003</questionnumber>
      <question>And the twelve must all agree before they are equal to the Presidency? Is that not a fact?</question>
      <answer>I do not know.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1004</questionnumber>
      <question>Well what is your best impression upon that?</question>
      <answer>I do not recollect what the revelation says upon that point.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1005</questionnumber>
      <question>You do not claim that if nine of the apostles were to claim a certain thing was right, and there of them were to claim it was wrong, that their decision would be equal to that of the Presidency?</question>
      <answer>Of course they would have to agree, - that is providing, - to say the twelve apostles if they were all in apostleship, - of course they would have to agree.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1006</questionnumber>
      <question>Now suppose the, - all of the twelve, and the Presidency should be removed at the same time, would the seventy in that case be appointed and have the same authority as the Presidency?</question>
      <answer>Well that would be a question for consideration. That is a thing that has never happened, and I cannot say what would be done in that case. That would be a thing to consider when such a condition of facts would come to pass. The seventy in that case would be the highest body in authority in the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1007</questionnumber>
      <question>The seventy holds equal authority with the twelve do they not?</question>
      <answer>In their office and in the performance of their specific functions they do. When they take up any case to decide, and when they agree or are all untied upon it, of course their decision is equal to that of the twelve. It is the same as the decision of the twelve in that event.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1008</questionnumber>
      <question>Well they hold in their office, when they take up any case to decide, and agree upon it, they hold equal authority with the twelve?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, in that matter they would.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1009</questionnumber>
      <question>You said the other day in your examination by Mr Hall that the endowments you received in Nauvoo were the same that you received here in Salt Lake City?</question>
      <answer>
        Well what we received this, - we were taught the same principles. As far as we had the priveledge of entering into these ordinances in Nauvoo, they were the same as were given here. We were taught these principles, all of them, there. We were taught the principles of the endowments there at Nauvoo.

      <answer>Yes sir, substantially the same.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1011</questionnumber>
      <question>You did not receive them in the same manner, in the same formula did you?</question>
      <answer>Well of course at first when it comes to that we did not, but we did after the temple was done. We did then I have repeatedly told you that they were substantially the same, for Joseph Smith taught us all the principles before his death.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1012</questionnumber>
      <question>Did he teach the formula of conferring the endowments that was practiced here after the migration from Nauvoo?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir, he taught the ordinances and formula, the ceremonies, all of them identically the same as they were taught here, that is so far as they could be practiced.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1013</questionnumber>
      <question>Now did Joseph Smith teach them outside of the temple?</question>

      <question>Now here is a book I want to be marked as exhibit "D" (the book referred to it marked exhibit "D"). I will hand you this pamphlet marked exhibit "D" Mr. Woodruff, and ask you to examine pages one, two, three and four, five, six, seven and eight, thereof, and say whether that formula, all of it, is the same formula, that was taught you in Nauvoo by Joseph Smith for receiving the endowments, or conferring the endowments?</question>
      <answer>Do you want me to read it?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1015</questionnumber>
      <question>Well you can look at that and see, satisfy yourself if it is the same thing?</question>
      <answer>Well I certainly would have to have time to look over these things, for I could not give you answer to something covering half a dozen pages of a pamphlet like that, without looking it over and reading it. (Witness hereupon examines the pages of the pamphlet marked exhibit "D", regarding which he is examined, and answers) What do you want me to do with this?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1016</questionnumber>
      <question>I want you to tell me whether that is the ceremony or formula that was taught by Joseph Smtih in Nauvoo in giving the endowments.</question>
      <answer>I can't tell you without I have time to read it, and I haven't time to read it here. As far as I see here, here is something I don't comprehend.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1017</questionnumber>
      <question>What is it you do not comprehend?</question>
      <answer>There are some plates here that I do not comprehend.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1018</questionnumber>
      <question>Joseph Smith did not present any such a thing to you as that did he?</question>
      <answer>As what?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1019</questionnumber>
      <question>As those plates represent?</question>
      <answer>No sir, and we never had any such plates as that, not that ever I saw. I don't know anything about them, I know we never had any such as some of them.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1021</questionnumber>
      <question>You swear to that do you?</question>

  <questionnumber>1022</questionnumber>
      <question>That is the representation of the division of a room, that is all is it not?</question>

  <questionnumber>1023</questionnumber>
      <question>It appears that in that representation there was a devil?</question>
      <answer>That seem to be the way this is gotten up.</answer>

      <question>Did Joseph Smith have a devil in his?</question>

  <questionnumber>1027</questionnumber>
      <question>You do not?</question>
      <answer>Well the figures I don't. I can't say as to the ceremonies. I can't say whether I would recognize them or not for I haven't had any time to read the whole thing. It will take time to read this so that I can answer the question.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1028</questionnumber>
      <question>Can't you look over that and answer the question as to whether or not that is the formula prescribed and followed out in the conferring of endowments as represented there?</question>
      <answer>No sir I cannot. You see you have a whole book here, and it will take time to go through and read it before I can answer intelligently. I cannot say what things here represented mean, for it is something I am unfamiliar with. I know what it is something that I am not acquainted with as having any part in the endowments.</answer>

  <questionnumber>1031</questionnumber>
      <question>In your cross examination Mr. Woodruff, you were asked the question if you considered the command to raise up righteous seed as spoken of in the book of Mormon, to be the one wife system?</question>
      <answer>No sir, I did not.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1032</questionnumber>
      <question>You did not?</question>
      <answer>No sir, I do not. It refers to a plurality of wives, because it refers to David and Solomon. That is what it undoubtedly refers to as it speaks of David and Solomon as well as others.</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked to witness on the ground and for the reason that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and hearsay, and moves the court to strike from the record the answer of the witness for the same reason.</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>1033</questionnumber>
      <question>State to the reporter what kind of marriage law,-or what kind of marriage law you think would be good in case there would be a commandment given to raise up seed unto the Lord?</question>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and calling for the opinion of the witness upon a question that is peculiarly in the breast of the of the Lord himself, and about which the witness knows nothing.</mono>
      <answer>I don't know but that that is true about a number of the questions that have been asked me. There has been many a thing asked me that I do not know anything about,-which the Lord alone knows. Now in regard to that question different men would have different opinions about it, and as far as I am concerned, as long as he was referring to the patriarchal order of marriage, referring to David and Solomon, and various other men, of course he forbid every person to do so, and then he states that if he would raise up righteous seed, he would command his people to do so. Now that is the view I would have of it.</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness on the grounds and for the reasons as set forth in the objection to the question to which it is an answer, and on the ground that the answer is absolutely unintelligible.</mono>

  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and on the further ground that the assumption of the party propounded the question that there was such a question asked the witness is not the fact, as there was no such a question asked the witness as the one just propounded.</mono>

      <answer>What is the question?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1036</questionnumber>
      <question>You were asked to give it as your opinion, as to whether or not he would command this people to observe the principle of having only one wife, or of having plural wives?</question>
      <answer>Well I understand as far as my views are concerned in regard to that subject, why of course he was threating upon the subject of plurality of wives in teaching the people there in those lands of America, and he refers to Solomon and David, and he forbid their practicing it there and he said if he would raise up seed unto himself, he would command his people, and of course there was hardly any commandment any where wherein a man should be commanded to go and marry one wife, - that is one woman, - that I know of.</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness to the question on the ground that it is not responsive hearsay and immeterial, and moves the court to strike the same from the record for the reasons given.</mono>
      <answer>I think myself that in answering a question like that it is a matter that depends very largely on the personal judgement of the person who is required to make the answer, and in that respect it is like a good many other things. In other words it is a matter of opinion very lagrely. Now that is all you have to say to me gentlemen, or is there something else?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1037</questionnumber>
      <question>Well Mr Woodruf that is not quite straight yet?</question>

  <questionnumber>1038</questionnumber>
      <question>Well the question I intended to ask you, - and I do not know whether I did put it exactly straight or not, was if he should command his people, would he command them to observe the one wife system, or the plural wife system?</question>
      <answer>Would be the plurality of wives of course.</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that the same is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and calling for an opinion of the witness only, and moves the court to strike form the record the answer of the witness for the foregoing reasons.</mono>
      <answer>My opinion is that it would be the plural wife system. Now that is my opinion.</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff moves the court to strike the answer from the record as being simply and strictly the opinion of the witness.</mono>

      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects tot he question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is irrelevant and immeterial, and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
      <answer>
        I was not there gentlemen, and of course I cannot say, but I would gather from the reading that she was a bond-woman by nationality, or a servant. I would judge that, but of course that is a great many things in connection with these matters that a person

      <question>I will get you to state to the reporter whether you know that that revelation was presented, or rather given on Fishing River in 1834, was ever presented to a conference or general assembly for acceptance by the church?</question>
      <answer>I don't think it was presented to the church. It was never presented to the church at any time that I have any knowledge of. There is no history to the effect that it was presented to the church, and my recollection does not serve me to say whether it was or not.</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, not the best evidence, nor redirect examination, and the motion is made to exclude the answer from the record for the same reason.</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>1041</questionnumber>
      <question>Do you know that any of the revelations that were printed in the different editions of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, after the 1835 edition, were ever presented to the church, and adopted by the church, before the death of Joseph Smith.</question>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and for the further reason that the witness is not competent to answer the question, as it appears from the testimony of the witness that he was not present at all of the conferences of the church during the time indicated in the question.</mono>
      <answer>Well I have no recollection of their ever having been presented to the church.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1042</questionnumber>
      <question>State to the reporter if the revelation concerning the war of the rebellion, the war between the north and the south, given in 1832, the revelation concerning the one mighty and string given in 1832, the revelation given in 1838 concerning tithing, the revelation given in 1838 concerning the name of the church, were considered or were accepted, any of them, by the church, or were accepted by the church any time prior to the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, as true revelations, and as a part of the law of the church?</question>
      <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is irrelevant and immaterial, is not proper redirect examination nor the best evidence.</mono>
      <answer>Yes sir, they were accepted. They were accepted the same as the other revelation were accepted. They were accepted as principles of truth.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1043</questionnumber>
      <question>Were they acted on by the quorums?</question>
      <answer>Oh, they never were presented that I know of before the conferences. In fact all that has been said here about revelations being presented to the church is just this way. There has been very few that I ever heard of or seen that were presented that way, that is formally to the conferences, and I have been in the church very near sixty years. I have been in the church I may say sixty years, and I never have seen them presented only in one or two instances. I think in 1835 the books were presented in the conference there concerning these revelations as doctrine to the church, and I think they have been presented to one conference there; but as revelations that have been given to Joseph Smith, or which have come through him, they have never been presented for reception or rejection as a general thing before the church, to my recollection.</answer>

      <question>Now I want to ask you one more question Mr. Woodruff?</question>
      <answer>All right sir.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1045</questionnumber>
      <question>I will ask you what time this Book of Mormon was printed and published?</question>
      <answer>It has been printed and published a good many times. Do you mean the first time?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1046</questionnumber>
      <question>Yes sir, when it first printed and published to the world?</question>
      <answer>Well that is a matter of guess you know as well as I do, for I was in the eastern country at that time, a miller attending a mill at the time that book was first printed. It was printed and published to the world before I ever heard of it at all.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1047</questionnumber>
      <question>Was it not in 1829 of 1830 that was done?</question>
      <answer>I think it was.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1048</questionnumber>
      <question>Now my friend Hall here got you to make a guess in regards to what the Lord would do, in case he commanded his people in reference to marriage, as to whether it would be a command to take one wife, or more than one, and he got you to say in your judgement he would command you to take two?</question>
      <answer>That was with reference to what was said here in connection with King Solomon and David, etc.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1049</questionnumber>
      <question>Now to refresh your recollection and show you that he got you to guess wrong I will read to you paragraph seven of section thirteen, from the revelation given in February 1831, where the Lord does speak on that question?</question>
      <answer>Very well, read it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1050</questionnumber>
      <question>"And again I say, thou shalt not kill, but he that killeth shall die. Thou shalt not steal, and he that stealeth and will not repent shall be cast out. Thou shalt not lie, he that lieth and will not repent shall be cast out. Thou shalt love they wife with all they heart, and shall cleave unto here none else; and he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit, and if he repent not he shall be cast out. Thou shalt not commit adultery, and he that committeth adultery and repenteth not shall be cast out; but he that commiteth adultery and repenteth with all his heart and forsaketh it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive, but if he doeth it again he shall not be forgiven, but shall be cast out." Now does that teach a plurality of wives?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is for an opinion of the witness, when he is here to testify to the facts.</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>1051</questionnumber>
      <question>Now sir I will read from section sixty five, paragraph three, page one hundred and ninety two, from the edition of 1835, as follows, "And again I say unto you that whoso forbiddeth to marry, is not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man; wherefore it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation, and that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made". What do you say to that? Does that teach a plurality of wives?</question>
      <answer>No sir.</answer>
      <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the ground that it is not recross examination, and does not call for the facts, but for a opinion of the witness.</mono>
      
  <questionnumber>1052</questionnumber>
      <question>Now I have read you two revelations where the lord has spoken on the question of marriage since the time of the publication of the Book of Mormon? Ain't that so Mr. Woodruff?</question>
      <answer>That is so.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1053</questionnumber>
      <question>And neither time that he has spoken of has he said that a man should or could have more wives than one, is that not the fact?</question>
      <answer>
        All of these revelations are given to the children of men, with reference to these principles, the principle of marriage etc, and it is something that is connected with the whole human family, and it is opposed to whoredoms and abominations of that kind, and if

        </pagenumber>the Lord gave us, as is stated there in the book of Mormon, - if the Lord raised up seed unto himself he would command his people, but he does not say that at all, - he does not say that he would command in that event, but of course we believe in the revelation which Joseph Smith received on that subject the latest revelation he received, which referred directly to the matter of the patriarchial order of marriage, and believing in it, or course we practiced it.

  <questionnumber>1054</questionnumber>
      <question>Now in answer to one of Mr Hall's questions, you spoke about a "seer", - about "the seer" as being a book containg the doctrine of your church?</question>
      <answer>I did not say that postively. I said it was presented there, and some of them may know about it. There may be some of the brethern here in the city who will know more about that than I do, - but I think I am correct when I say that all the books were presented to one conference here, and I think the object of presenting them was with reference to the "Seer" which was represented as being revelations from the book of Abraham. It was represented to come from that book, and there was a whole lot of important things in it, but it was only a small book any way.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1055</questionnumber>
      <question>Now do you mean "the Seer", or "The Pearl of Great Prince"?</question>
      <answer>Ain't they both one?</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1056</questionnumber>
      <question>No sir they are not, and I don't want to mislead you?</question>
      <answer>Well then if there are not one and the same I don't know which one it was. The one I refer to was only a small book any way, that did not amount to much from point of size.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1057</questionnumber>
      <question>Well the Seer is a publication by Washington Pratt?</question>
      <answer>Well then I think it must have been the Pearl of Great Price. I must have been mistaken, but then I am subject to these lapses of memory.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1058</questionnumber>
      <question>So then the Pearl of Great price was made a part of the doctrine of the church?</question>
      <answer>Well it was presented as the faith we believe. We believed in the principles of it, - that was the idea of it.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1059</questionnumber>
      <question>Were there any ordinances in it that you practiced or conferred?</question>
      <answer>I don't know that there was any ordinances in it at all.</answer>
      
  <questionnumber>1060</questionnumber>
      <question>Well then it was just apart of the faith of the church, - that is the way you understand it?</question>
      <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
      <mono>Witness fees $1.50 paid by defendants. It being impossible to conclude the taking of the evidence herein one this day, the further taking of the same was by the examiner continued until the forenoon of Tuesday March 22nd at the hour of 9.30 o'clock then and there to be continued at the place in that behalf first aforesaid.

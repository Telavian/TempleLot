  <questionnumber>19</questionnumber>
  <mono>By Mr. P.P. Kelley: I will offer this record now, Mr. Southern. (The record reffered to was hereupon handed to the Notary and marked "Exhibit 21".) By Mr. Southern: Well, the defendents object to the record offered in evidence because a record of the character of the record shown here in evidence is not competent testimony in this case, and because it has been shown in this case that the original deed is within the reach of the parties who desire to offer the record, and because scraps of a record of this kind do not indicate the character and nature of the instrument of a muniment of title to real estate, and because it has not been shown that the original deed was properly signed by the party purporting to sign it, or properly acknowledged in accordance with the law in that regard. By Mr. P.P. Kelley: Let the record show right here, that in lieu of the copy of the deed that has been read being offered in evidence that plaintiff's counsel now asks the deputy recorder of deeds for Jackson County, Missouri, now on the witness stand, make a duly certified copy of the record in question and present it here tomorrow morning. By Mr. Southern: To all of which the defendants object because it is not relevant or competent to any of the issues in this case. By Mr. P.P. Kelley:</mono>

By Mr. Southern, - "That is objected to, first, - because the paper offered in evidence does not purport to be a deed, but only the copy of a record of a deed, and secondly, - because there is nothing in the body of the paper purporting to be a copy of the record of a deed, and secondly, - because there is nothing in the body of the paper showing definately anything that purports to be a conveyance of the property in question, and thirdly, because the language of the paper shows it to be a true copy of the record, and the record be a true copy of the original paper, that it is not a deed as it purports to be, fourthly, - because the paper offered in evidence does not purport to be, or to have been dated, - fifthly, - there is nothing given in testimony to show that the name attached to the paper was ever attached to an original deed of which the paper purports to be a copy, - sixth, because it has not been shown in testimony that the original paper, purporting to be a deed has been lost or destroyed, or is not within the reach of these plaintiffs". By Mr. B.P. Kelley, - "Mr. Reporter just after that objection let the record show that plaintiffs counsel state when he offered the deed that he would follow it up by showing that the original deed was not in his possession or under his control, and he would show that fact".

  <question>I will ask you to read from the Times and Seasons, published October 1st 1842 in the city of Nauvoo, on pages 939 and 940, - just look at it and see if that is something you can identify that as something you have read, or did read, while living at Nauvoo?

Bennett's "secret wife system", is a creature of his own make, as we know of no such society in this place, nor never did." Yes sir I read that at the time it was published or soon thereafter.</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>25</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state to the reporter if you know anything about the secret wife system referred to in those certificates?</question>

  <answer>I do not know anything about it sir of my own knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>26</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to - state what the system of plural marriage was that was taught to you or talked about in Nauvoo, Illinois, before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <mono>By Mr P.P. Kelley, - "We object to that for the reason that it is immetyrial, and irrelevant and incompetent, and is hearsay, and the witness has distinctly stated he did not know anything about it only from hearsay."</mono>
  <answer>I did not hear anything or see anything direct from Joseph Smith himself while I was there in Nauvoo but others who were his clerks and secretaries and such like, - I had communication from them while I was living there on that question.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness as hear say, and move the court to exclude it from the record for that reason.</mono>

    </pagenumber>that time. He was also one of the twelve and was with him all of the time I might say up to the teim of his death, and was with him then also.
  </answer>

  <question>I will ask you to state what you were taught by those men?</question>
  <answer>Which men?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>By Williard Richards, - what that principle of plural marriage was that you were taught by him?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and hearsay.</mono>

  <questionnumber>32</questionnumber>
  <question>Afterwards published where?</question>
  <answer>Here in Salt Lake City.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>
  <question>Well state if you had any knowledge or information of a revelation on that subject before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects tot he question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is immeterial, and hearsay, and a cross examination by defendant by its own witness.</mono>
  <answer>I was informed there was a revelation on that subject but as I stated before I did not see it.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness on the ground that it is immeterial, and not responsive to the question, and moves the court to strike it from the record for that reason, and for the additional reason that it is hearsay.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>35</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you so informed by any of the officers of the church?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, leading and hearsay.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir, I was informed of it.</answer>

  <question>Before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>

  <questionnumber>37</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any difference, or what was the difference between the principle of plural marriage as taught you there, and the John C. Bennett secret wife system, - if you know of any difference, you may state what it was?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is leading, incompetent, and irrelevant and immeterial.</mono>
  <answer>The difference in the main is, so far as I understand it, or did understand it, is that Bennett and others taught simply the system of polygamy, and practiced it also to a pretty liberal extent, while the revelation give and the principles, - I mean the principles in the revelation given by Joseph Smith and taught by him and the Mormon church to the people at that time, did not embrace the principle of polygamy as it is understood in the usual acceptance of the term, which as I understand it gives a wife the right to several husbands, as it gives the husband the right to several wives. Bennet's system was entirely opposed to the practices of the revelation, which was on the subject of celestial marriage.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>38</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Did the principle of celestial marriage permit a man to have more than one wife living at the same time?

  <question>I will read to you a communication that appeared in the Times & Seasons, published November 15th 1844, and ask you after I have read it, whether you read that at the time or about the time that it was published, - "The saints of the last days have witnessed the outgoings and incoming of so many apostates, that nothing but truth has any effect on them. In the present instance, after the sham quotations of Sidney and his clique from the Bible, the book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants, to skulk off under the dreadful splendor of spiritual wifery, which is brought into the account as graciously as if the law of the land allowed a man a plurality of wives is fiendish, and like the rest of Sidney's revelation just because he wanted to go to Pittsburg and live. Wo to the man or men who will thus wilfully lie to injure an innocent people. The law of the land and the rules of the church do not allow one man to have more than one wife alive at once, but if any man's wife die, he has a right to marry another and be sealed to both for eternity, to the living and the dead. There is no law of God or man against it. This is all the spiritual wife system that was ever tolerated in the church, and they know it," Now did you ever read that in the Times and Seasons?</question>

  <answer>
    Yes sir, for the system of plural marriage was not practiced by the church as a body.

  <questionnumber>142</questionnumber>
  <question>State why it was not taught to the church publicly, if you know?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question on the grounds above set forth.</mono>
  <answer>Well all the reason I ever heard of was that it was not considered proper to do so under the circumstances at that time. It was not thought advisable at that time to make the revelation known to the church in its application to the general church body, because the body of the church generally were not expected to engage in it at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>143</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you to state if there were any other revelations that were acted on in the same way from the organization of the church up to the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, leading and calling for hearsay testimony.</mono>
  <answer>I have heard of quite a number, - I have heard quite a number spoken of as being that way. Whenever there was revelations given in that way, - now I did not get this from the prophet Joseph, but it was generally understood, and talked of that revelations were not published until some time after they were given. In other words there was a sufficient time allowed to elapse before they were published for the church and the authorities to understand them, - that is for the authorities and quoroms of the church to arrive at an understanding of them.</answer>

  <questionnumber>156</questionnumber>
  <question>Mr Hall asked you if you knew of revelations that were received and were not presented to the church, and were not to be presented to the church for a time; now I want to ask you if you ever knew of a revelation that was received that was not to be presented to the church at all?</question>
  <answer>Well that is considered I think equivalent to publishing it to the world if it is published to the church it is the the equivalent of publishing it to the world.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>157</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is your opinion about it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That is my opinion about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>158</questionnumber>
  <question>If the church was to be taught it, then it would be published to the world?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>159</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Then do you understand Mr Richards, that revelation could be received, and the church be bound by them before they were revealed to the church, - that the church would be bound by them before it knew anything about them? </question>
    <mono>Counsel for the defendant objects to the question asked the witness as not proper re-cross examination, and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
    <answer>No sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>160</questionnumber>
    <question>Before they were presented to the church and adopted?</question>
    <answer>No sir I do not consider that they would be binding upon the church only so far as they were made known to the church and adopted.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>161</questionnumber>
    <question>Well would they have to be presented to the church, and be adopted by the church - before they would become a law to the church?</question>
    <answer>No sir.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>162</questionnumber>
    <question>Could they become a law to the church before they were adopted by the church, so as to bind the members?</question>
    <answer>The rules of the church were such that where a revelation was given by the prophet Joseph Smith, that they were received by the church then published by the church, or to the church, but the church was not re-quired to know of their existence, until they were published to the church. While they would not be a law to the body of the church or the church as a church, still they would be a rule and law unto such as knew of their existence and their terms, and accepted them.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>163</questionnumber>
    <question>The church had a right to reject them if it wanted to didn't it?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir, Not only the church but any member of the church could if they wished to do so.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>164</questionnumber>
    <question>Or the whole body could?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir, - if they chose to do so they could. All men, yourself included, have a perfect right to reject the truth if they do so however they would be held accountable for doing it, but that is their right beyond question.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>165</questionnumber>
    <question>And they were taught in the revelation that everything must be done by the common consent of the church, and in the church?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir. Everything that was done was.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>166</questionnumber>
    <question>Must be done by common consent?</question>
    <answer>Yes sir</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>167</questionnumber>
    <question>Then would a revelation be binding on the church until the church had acted upon it, - would it be binding on the church as a law, or in any other way?</question>
    <answer>Just so far as the faith of the church and its members would receive it and act upon it.</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>168</questionnumber>
    <question>Would it be binding upon them before they had faith and accepted it??</question>
    <answer>Well I can't say. I don't suppose that it would be binding upon me unless I had faith and accepted it.</answer>

    <question>Well as a fact it would not be binding upon any body until they exhibited their faith by excepting it but as a matter of fact it would not be a law that any one could legally act upon or under until it had been acted upon by the church and accepted, no matter what any ones individual opinion may have been.</question>
    <answer>No sir it would not be binding upon the church or a law or rule of action to the church until it was accepted by the church.</answer>

    <question>Would any member of the church be liable to be disciplined, because of a revelatiol, or failure to obey the provisions of a revelation before the church had adopted it as a part of the law and rules and practices governing the church?</question>
    <answer>Well sir that is a question that might require some explanation to give a proper answer to it. There are revelations given that apply particularly to the members of various quoroms; and special persons in the church, and of course in these cases the revelations are binding only upon these persons.</answer>

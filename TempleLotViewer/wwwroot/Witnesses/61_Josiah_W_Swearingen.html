    By Mr. Kelley, - "We have no questions to ask the witness. We move however, to exclude all the evidence of this witness from the record on the ground that it is immaterial and incompetent." By Mr. Southern, - "Now I re-offer all the tax receipts here-to-fore offered in evidence by the defendants, numbered from exhibit "105" to exhibit "142" inclusive. It the numbers given to the tax receipts above offered I wish it to include each and every tax receipt offered in evidence, whatever their number may be." Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the foregoing offer of proof for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and for the further reason that the property being church property was not subject to taxation, and this the receipts show on their face, - that it was church property." By Mr. Southern, - "I ask that a fee of five dollars be allowed as costs for the copy of the tax books marked exhibit "160". By P.P. Kelley, - "Plaintiff objects to the allowance of five dollars or any other sum, for the reason that the purported transcript is not a transcript of any record authorized by law to be made, and is a transcript of things wholly and aboslutely immaterial irrelevant and incompetent in this case; but if the court should hold that the evidence is material and admissible, and is a proper matter to be offered in testimony by transcript, the the fee may be five dollars." By Mr. Southern, - "Defendant rests." I, John M. Orr, a Notary Public, within and for the county of Jackson and the state of Missouri, do hereby certify that the above and foregoing eight hundred and twelve pages of type-written transcript, is a correct and accurate transcript of my short hand notes of the testimony of the various witnesses whose names are therein set forth, and that their said depositions were taken before me at the times and places here in before specified, and that the witnesses were duly sworn and their said examinations written down by me at the time in the presence of each and all of said witnesses, in short-hand in pursuance of an agreement and stipulation entered into by the parties hereto as herein before set forth whereby it was agreed and stipulated entered into by the parties hereto as herein before set forth whereby it was agreed and stipulated that the undersigned Notary Public should take all the depositions of all the witnesses for both parties hereto as well as record all other testimony introduced of whatever nature or character and that the signatures

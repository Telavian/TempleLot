  <answer>Well it originated there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>There at Voree?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, at any rate that was the first I ever heard of it any way. Now that is my opinion about it, if it is proper to give an opinion, that is that it originated there, but I am not prepared to say that it originated there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>78</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know anything about who originated that covenant as it was called?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say, but it is my opinion that John C. Bennett and Mr. Strang originated that covenant.</answer>

  <question>You say you published it yourself?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>83</questionnumber>
  <question>Are any of these publications in existence?</question>
  <answer>I don't know, there may be some existing. I understood that there were. I understood that there was one in my neighborhood close by, but that I don't know to be a fact, but I never retained one for I did not consider that it was of any great value or importance, or else I should have done so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>84</questionnumber>
  <question>Could you not give a little more fully the nature or object of that covenant?</question>
  <answer>The nature and object of the covenant was to explain the same. I don't know that I can explain it, but I was present at the initiating of the great many members, and the object of the covenant as I told you was to bind them together in a bind the obligations of which it was conceived could not be broken. The ones who were initiated were required to sign their names in their own blood, and I could not repeat much of the covenant verbatim, it all was long ago these things occurred, and I can not charge myself now with what occurred then, as I have allowed it to pass from my mind, as I am some what forgetful.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>85</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what penalty was there for a violation of that covenant?</question>

  <questionnumber>87</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was it?</question>
  <answer>They were to be jeopardized, and their persons and property were to be placed at the will, and to be outraged by any one who belonged to that covenant. They undertook to carry out that measure, but their forces were not strong enough to do so, and they had quite a rough time there about the time it was played out.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>88</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you have not answered my question, was there anything violent connected with a violation of the secrets of that covenant?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know that there was personally, but it was generally understood that you were to be an outcast.</answer>

  <question>What was to be done with the outcast, - what was to be the punishment inflicted upon him, - was he to be banished in any way?</question>

  <answer>It was not very long.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>95</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about how long?</question>
  <answer>Well I should think it was about eight months.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>96</questionnumber>
  <question>About eight months?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - something like that bout, I should think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>97</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say it was exposed and then abandoned?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Well no I don't say that it was abandoned in the sense that it was finally given up, but it was exposed, and then it was discontinued for a while. They discontinued having their meetings there, and then they made their preperations to go to Beaver Island. They sent a committee out to hunt a place to go and the committee after making its investigations reported on Beaver Island as the best place to locate, and then they began making their preperations to go there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>98</questionnumber>
  <question>No you say that the covenant was exposed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>99</questionnumber>
  <question>Who made that exposure?</question>
  <answer>I was the first one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>100</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the result?</question>
  <answer>I proposed to speak on the covenant, and they knowing my position and knowledge of it by reason of being Strang's privy counsellor, and I gave out there an appointment in which I proposed to explain that covenant, and that was held in a private house, that is the meeting was in which I explained it, and after that eighteen of the most prominent members said that they would stand by me, and so we put our shoulders to the wheel, and as my self and a sister remembered the covenant verbatim, we wrote it out and sent it to Elkhorn, and had it published and throwed it around promiscuously, - broad cast you might say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>101</questionnumber>
  <question>That was what you did?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>102</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now you have told what was done, - what was the result?</question>
  <answer>Well the result was that it pretty much broke up their taking of the covenant there, - it pretty much broke up their organization there, and then they began to make their preperations to move to Beaver Island as I said before.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>103</questionnumber>
  <question>You say "they", - whom do you mean by "they"?</question>
  <answer>I mean Strang's followers, and they went with quite a number of the old Latter Day Saints to Beaver Island.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>104</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you go with them?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not go.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>105</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what proportion went with Strang to Beaver Island?</question>
  <answer>Of those that were there at Voree?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>106</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well they all went you might say that believed in Strang, - there were so many that there was no branch left there to organize.</answer>

  <questionnumber>107</questionnumber>
  <question>About all the members that were there went to Beaver Island with Strang?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, after they left there was not enough Latter Day Saints left there to organize a branch.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>108</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you remain there all the time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, - I moved about a mile from Voree to Burlington, - that was about a mile from Voree and was where Strang first located.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>109</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you organize a branch of the church there at Burlington?</question>
  <answer>No sir there was no organization of the church there, but there was a great many of the old Latter Day Saints that were with Strang that settled around there for immediate quarters, but they finally settled all over as they got scattered around.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>110</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever hear of the practice of polygamy in the church?</question>

  <questionnumber>111</questionnumber>
  <question>Where did you hear first of it?</question>
  <answer>Well I heard of it after we got there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>112</questionnumber>
  <question>After you got there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, - after it got there I should say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>113</questionnumber>
  <question>After it got there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>114</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you don't know when it got there?</question>
  <answer>No sir I can't say that I do just know the date that it got there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>115</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when did you first hear of its being there with reference to the time that you got there?</question>
  <answer>Well I never heard of it until a little over a year after I got there. I never heard of polygamy or the doctrine of plural wives until then I think. No it was a little over a year after Joseph Smith's death.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>116</questionnumber>
  <question>It was a year after Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, about that, - a little over a year perhaps.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>117</questionnumber>
  <question>Well where did you hear of it then?</question>
  <answer>As I said before I believe I lived about eighteen miles from Nauvoo at the first, and then I moved into Nauvoo in the winter, and wintered there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>118</questionnumber>
  <question>That is where you first heard of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>119</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know how it originated?</question>
  <answer>Well I have my opinion, whilst I cannot say that I know it I have my opinion all the same. I believe I have my opinion pretty well grounded too from observation, and know how it originated and who was the originator of polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>120</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you may state it?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, - "I object to that for the reason that the foundation for asking the question is not sufficiently laid. By Mr Traber, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>121</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question?</question>
  <answer>I believe the originator was Williard Richards and Parley Pratt.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>122</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they hold any office in the church at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir they were members of the Quorom of Twelve as it existed then. I believe that Parley Pratt was the prime originator of the system of polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>123</questionnumber>
  <question>What reason have you for believing that?</question>
  <answer>I believe he was the first man that started and headed it, and I think his after history proves that fact. He wrote a book, - at least I was satisfied that he wrote a book called Father Jacobs, and that introduced polygamy in a round about way.</answer>

  <question>What kind of a book was that?</question>
  <answer>It was rather an obscene book for I read it, and I know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>125</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you read that book?</question>

    I was pretty well acquainted with one of the sisters, and she had it, and let me have it, and its existence was kept pretty well secret in the church, - that is every

    </pagenumber>body in the church did not know of its existence, but one of the sisters in the church who occupied a pretty prominent place in the female councils of the church had the book and she let me have it, and it was rather on the obscene order. It was distributed around amongst the leading sisters, and it taught the introduction of this institution amongst the younger sisters. Now that is my opinion, - that Parley Pratt was the founder or originator of that institution of polygamy, and while that is my belief I could not prove it.

  <question>Was or was it not the practice of Joseph Smith to call the elders together and talk to them on doctrinal points?</question>
  <mono>By Mr Southern, -- "I think I must object to that question also because it is leading, and for every other reason that I know of."</mono>
  <answer>Shall I answer that question?</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Trabert, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>131</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, you may answer it?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I ever knew him to call them together as a body, and talk to them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>132</questionnumber>
  <question>He never called them together as a body, and talked to them on doctrinal points?</question>
  <answer>No sir I never knew him, that I remember of, to call them together as a body, but I have often heard him talk to them from the stand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>133</questionnumber>
  <question>Well to whom would he talk, - would it be to a congregation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That would be as he preached on ordinary occasions. I never knew him to call the eldership together specially, however. I knew that to be the practice after his death, but never before his death.</answer>

  <question>As an elder in the church at that time, - that is before the time of the death of Joseph Smith, do you know what the doctrines of the church were at that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I did. I did both before Joseph Smith's death and afterwards, for I had some experience in both, and it was quite the reverse after his death. There was quite a decided change after his death, for after his death we were called together by the Twelve as it was then constituted, and as I belonged to a quorom our quoroms were called together and questioned by the President of the quoroms, as to whether they could or would preach such and such doctrines if they were sent out, and that was done to know and asertain: if they would be competent to be sent out and represent the church in the field, so to speak, and preach all that was taught by the Presidency and the Twelve.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>138</questionnumber>

  <question>You said you attended this gathering that was held there at that time when you were questioned as to your willingness to get out and preach and teach polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I attended with my quorums. You must understand that there were different quorums in the church and they were all called together in the same way and questioned.</answer>

  <question>Well what occurred then?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I was expelled from my quorum at that time.

The next time we were called together afterr the expiration of that period of grace, I was of the same opinion still, and so they then struck my name off the membership of the quorum.</answer>

  <question>The doctrine of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I have never held to it, and never believed in it, and have always been strongly in opposition to that doctrine, and that was the reason I left their organization there at Nauvoo - in consequence of my opposition to that doctrine of polygamy. Well it was not that alone, for there was many other doctrines, that I objected to and would not accept.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>155</questionnumber>
  <question>That was not the only reason of your leaving that organization they had there at Nauvoo after the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for there were many appendages to the doctrines added there, that I did not consider to be the true doctrine of the church, or the original doctrine of the church, and as I was asked to embrace them and refused to do so, I was read out of the church, or left it of my own free will, - I don't hardly know which. Now I was not expelled from the church, but from my quorum, understand me.</answer>

  <questionnumber>160</questionnumber>
  <question>You are satisfied that he practiced it at both of these places?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir,-I am satisfied that he did from the history that I have of Mr. Strang, but I don't know this of my own knowledge, for I did not see him practice it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>161</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I don't want you to state anything that you don't know of your own knowledge,-just state what you have personal knowledge of yourself, and nothing else?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir, about such a matter,-I was given to the next meeting to consider it, and then when I was asked again to do so and persisted in my refusal I was stricken from my quorum, together with some other members who refused along with me. That is what we were expelled for,-because we would not edorse the doctrine of polygamy and would not teach it if we were sent out.</answer>

  <question>From the position you held in the church at that time, if Joseph Smith the prophet and seer, had ever taught or practiced polygamy, would you have known of it?</question>
  <answer>I think I would have know of it. I was acquainted with the church from almost its first origin, and with al the old members in the church,-that is the first members who-were considered to be in good standing, etc, and I think I should have known something about it if he had.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>166</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did he?</question>
  <answer>I don't think he did, I don't think there is any question about that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>167</questionnumber>
  <question>There is no question about that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not the slightest question about it, for my opportunities were such that I would certainly have know about it. My opportunities were such that I would have found it out.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>168</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you know, or do you know of any one at that time connected with the church in an official capacity, who ever taught or practiced polygamy at any time during the life of Joseph Smith?</question>

  <question>What if any thing, do you know about the ordinance of the endowment in the church at that time?</question>
  <answer>At what time?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>171</questionnumber>
  <question>Well say at any time?</question>
  <answer>The endowments that they had in Nauvoo do you mean?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>172</questionnumber>
  <question>At any place, or at any time?</question>
  <answer>I don't know much about them, for I never attended any of the endowments. I refused to go into the temple at Nauvoo or have anything to do with it, for I got quite disgusted with my observations on the way things wer going in the church. I had paid my tithes and I was invited to go in for we paid by wards, and I refused to go in with my ward.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>173</questionnumber>
  <question>When was that?</question>
  <answer>That was in the winter of 1845 or 1846.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>174</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that practiced before Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>175</questionnumber>
  <question>It was after his death?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it was two years,-yes it was a little over two year after his death, that that was done. That is when this took place,-a little over two years after Joseph Smith's Death, that the endowment took place,. That is the endowment where they sealed.</answer>

  <questionnumber>176</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was in the winter of 1845 or 1846?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, -it was the last winter that they lived in Nauvoo.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>177</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you informed as to where that practice originated?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know as I said before. I gave you the name of the party who I thought originated polygamy. They originated the practice of it that winter, by the proclamation of Brigham Young's, who declared the year of jubilee, and that proclamation declared that all those who chose were free to choose for eternity, and that constituted the introduction of polygamy, for they were free to choose one or more wives if they saw fit for eternity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>178</questionnumber>
  <question>That was in accordance you say with a proclamation issued by Brigham Young?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>179</questionnumber>
  <question>In which he declared the year of jubilee?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>180</questionnumber>
  <question>Now can you fix the time when that was done?</question>
  <answer>Well it was early in the fall of 1845, and it run on through the winter of 1846 I am not sure of the date but it was the last winter they were there, and they left there in the spring or summer of 1846 some time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>181</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they have an endowment house there?</question>
  <answer>No sir they used the temple, and you could perhaps call that an endowment house. The temple was partly finished at that time, -at all events sufficiently so as to enable them to attend to that part of their ceremonies in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>182</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did they have any separate house in which these endowments were given?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not that I know anything of. If they did I don't know anything of it, for I understand that the endowments and sealing were all done in the temple. That was what I was informed, and I guess there is no doubt but that my information is correct.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>183</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you did not take any part in it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, although I was advised, or invited to take part along with my ward, I refused to do so, for I did not want to have anything to do with the endowments for I believed it to be an innovation on the doctrines of the church, and I had no faith or belief in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>184</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was the nature and extent of the endowments as you understood it at that time?</question>
  <answer>Well there was a ceremony that they had there, and went through with that I understood to be, that they were to live entirely by the counsel of their superiors, -that is they were to follow their counsel in everything. They taught that there publicly in the temple hall that the book of covenants was like a steam boat that had gone up, and they had no use for it but we were to be governed and live by the counsel of our superiors. The principle teaching that they sought to impress upon the membership was to obey the council, and they had no more use for the book of Covenants as they termed it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>185</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you mean to say that they taught that the book of Covenants was to be discarded?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and there was to be no more attention paid to it by those that endorsed Brigham's theory.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>186</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they refer to the book of Mormon in any way?</question>
  <answer>Well they endorsed the book of Mormon.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>187</questionnumber>
  <question>They endorsed the book of Mormon then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I expect so for I never heard anything to the contrary.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>188</questionnumber>
  <question>What place if any, was set apart for conferring these endowments before Joseph Smith's death?</question>
  <answer>
    I don't know of any place. I never heard of any place.

  </answer>
  <question>Were they conferred before the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>I have said that they were not that I knew anything of, and from the relation I sustained to the church I don't believe they could have been conferred without my knowing it, therefore I say they were not.</answer>

  <answer>I was called in there to Nauvoo with all the surrounding branches by Brigham Young's proclamation, at the time that the people not members of the church were gathering in mobs for the purpose of doing violence to the Saints and persecuting them, for at that time we were advised together into Nauvoo so that we could the better protect ourselves from the violence of the mob, and so I went in there for winter quarters in the fall of 1845, and I lived there through that winter and in the spring of 1846 I left there?.</answer>

  <answer>I can't say, but it was not a great while.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>389</questionnumber>
  <question>Now on what occasion did you first hear of this doctrine of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say. I can't say what was the first I heard of it, but the first positive evidence I had of its being the doctrine taught by Brigham's organization, was when it was presented to my quorom. I had heard rumors of it before that time, but that was the first I ever heard of its being the doctrine of the organization they had there that Brigham Young was the head of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>390</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I asked you on what occasion did you first hear of the doctrine of - polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Well that would be hard to say, for I heard of it from a great many sources. From any source you might say or it was a matter of common talk - there during the winter, - It was marrying gor eternity, so as to get the right wife I supposed,</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>391</questionnumber>

    </pagenumber>that winter, and I stated that I had heard rumors of it before it was officially presented in the quorum, but I cannot begin to tell you who I heard speak of it, that is something beyond my power, for I do not remember it. Now when I come to think of it I don't think that I did hear of it. I might have heard rumors of it before I went on that quorum of seventy, but I rather think I did not, but at any rate pretty soon after I went on that quorum we were called together and instructed that that was a doctrine that we would have to preach if we were sent out, and I repudiated it, and then I was cut off for my action.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>394</questionnumber>

  <question>Well state about how many months you belonged to it?</question>
  <answer>Well may be five or six months, something like that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>399</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you hear it preached at the time you joined the quorum?</question>
  <answer>I said a while ago that I had, but that was owing to the fact that I misunderstood the question, for I never heard it preached.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>400</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you hear of, did you hear it talked of at the time, or prior to the time that you joined that quorum?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but I heard of the doctrine of sealing one woman to a man for eternity. I heard of that but not about polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>401</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you hear that talked of?</question>
  <answer>
    At the introduction of polygamy.
	</answer>
    
  <questionnumber>402</questionnumber>W: Well when?
  </answer>
  <answer>Well at that time, just a little before it, for that was introductory to polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>403</questionnumber>
  <question>I understand you to say that you heard of the circumstance of women being sealed to mean before you heard the doctrine of polygamy openly advocated?</question>
  <answer>I never heard the doctrine of polygamy publicly advocated in the world. Never.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>404</questionnumber>
  <question>You never heard of it publicly?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never heard it publicly advocated at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>405</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how did you hear it?</question>
  <answer>I heard it in the quorum at the time that I spoke of, but that was just to the quorum, and then I heard it talked about in a great many circles. It was a matter of common chat amongst the people in a private way that winter, but I did not hear it publicly.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>406</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you did hear it taught in the quorum?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>407</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you hear it taught in the quorum?</question>
  <answer>Polygamy?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>408</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>Well that was in the spring of 1845, I think. I joined the quorum in 1845, and I think it was in the spring that it was taught to us there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>409</questionnumber>
  <question>If you joined the quorum in the fall of 1845, it must have been in the spring of 1846 that you heard it taught in the quorum, and not in 1845?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir it was in 1846 and not in 1845.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>410</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you join the quorum?</question>
  <answer>I think it was in the spring of 1845.</answer>

  <question>That was the time that you joined the quorum?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>413</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what season in the year was it that you first heard of it?</question>
  <answer>Well it was in the spring or winter. I don't make any, dates on it, for I don't remember, I might possibly be mistaken about that.</answer>

  <questionnumber>414</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you say now that you became a member of the quorom in the spring of 1845</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think that was the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>415</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I understood you a moment ago to say that you became a member of that quorom in the fall of 1845?</question>
  <answer>Well that was the time I joined the quorom, -I did not understand what you meant, -I thought you referred to the time I first heard polygamy spoken of, and that was the time. I can't remember these things as to the dates that I heard this and that for I did not charge my mind with it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>416</questionnumber>
  <question>Well answer me this question, -did you hear polygamy spoken of before you were a member of the quorom of seventy?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>417</questionnumber>
  <question>You are positive of that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for there was nothing known about polygamy--at the time that I became a member of the quorom., but it was not long after that that it was introduced as a subject of conversation, or common chat.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>418</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you know say you joined the quorom of seventy in the spring of 1845?</question>
  <answer>I think it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>419</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I want you to be as nearly accurate about that as you possibly can be?</question>
  <answer>Well I think it was some where near that time. I can't be positive, but I think it was some where near then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>420</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you must have become a member of the quorom of seventy in the spring of 1845 and not in the fall of 1845?</question>
  <answer>In the spring?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>421</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, I say you must have become a member of the quorom which you joined in the spring of 1845 instead of in the fall?</question>
  <answer>Well I am not positive as to whether it was in the spring or in the fall. I could not say positively as to that sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>422</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there not something that will enable you to fix the time with reference to the season of the year that you joined that quorom?</question>
  <answer>I can't say, -I can't tell you positively when it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>423</questionnumber>
  <question>Well can't you call to mind something with reference as to what kind of weather it was, that will enable you to fix more definitely the time of year it was?</question>
  <answer>It was a long time ago-that all this occured, and I am a little forgetful about these things, and I don't know that I can recall anything that will help to fix that in my mind. I don't know that I can recall anything that will fix it in the spring or in the fall.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>424</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you say that you heard it spoken of after you joined the quorom of seventy?</question>
  <answer>I did.</answer>

  <question>Now did you hear it spoken of in a meeting of the quorom?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>426</questionnumber>
  <question>How did it come up in the quorom?</question>
  <answer>The quorom was called together specially for that matter to be presented to them, and that question was propounded to the quorom that I belonged to by its President, and he wanted to know if the members of the quorom would agree to teach that principle, -that is the principle of plural marriage or polygamy as it is called, in case they were sent out to preach the faith as it then existed, and the statement was made by the (President of the) quorom if there was any body there that would not agree to preach and each it they would be expelled. That is what I know occured in the quorom that I belonged to, and I understand that all the other quoroms were called together, and asked the same question.</answer>

  <questionnumber>442</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you do not remember the name of the first man that spoke to you on that question?</question>
  <answer>I can't remember the name.</answer>

  <question>Well I will ask you if it is not likely that you would remember the name of the person who first poke to you upon a question of such great importance to the church?</question>
  <answer>I cannot remember, but as I said before I talked with some persons who took the endowment there, and they informed me that they were introduced as a part of the ceremonies in the church in 1846, I have talked with different ones who have been through the endowments, and some of them were sealed.</answer>

    </pagenumber>One to approach-you on the question of polygamy,-if such an approach would have been shocking to you?
  </question>
  <answer>Well it was not on the streets.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>448</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am not asking you anything about the streets or what occurred on the streets,-I asked you if it would not have shocked you for some one to approach you on the question of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I want you to understand that, I was never approached to endorse the system at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>449</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am not asking you that either. I asked you if it would not have shocked you, and did it not have that effect on you when the question was first broached in your presence?</question>
  <answer>I did not like it I can assure you,-it was not a very-palatable to me,-on the contrary it was very distasteful to me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>450</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if it had that effect on you why is it that you cannot remember who it was first spoke of it?</question>
  <answer>Well as I before told you I don't know what I can give you the date of time that it was first spoken of in my presence, or the name of the party who first spoke of it,-in fact I am sure that I cannot do that, but it was some thing like eighteen months or such a matter after Joseph's death. Well perhaps it was not much over a year after Joseph's death that polygamy was introduced, or became talked about as a matter of more or less general conversation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>451</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how does it come that you can state it was over a year, or within a year after Joseph Smith's death that you heard it,-that it became talked about and you cannot state when it was first talked about?</question>
  <answer>Well I can remember these things in a general way of course, but all this occurred so long back,-nearly fifty years ago it was,-that I cannot remember who I first heard talk about it, or when I first heard it talked about only in a general way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>452</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will ask you if such a revolting doctrine did not make an impression on your memory?</question>
  <answer>Certainly. I remember right well the fact that it was spoken of to me and that I did not approve of it, and so expressed myself at the time. I would not remember however that I heard it at such and such a time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>453</questionnumber>
  <question>Would it not be impressed upon your memory so that you could specify the names of the persons whom you fist heard speak of it?</question>
  <answer>Well I could specify the names of a great many men if I felt so disposed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>454</questionnumber>
  <question>What is that?</question>
  <answer>I say I could state the names of a great many men I heard speak about it if I felt so disposed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>455</questionnumber>
  <question>Well are you disposed to state their names?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. 456 Well who are they?</answer>
  <answer>I heard Phineas Young and quite a number of different men that I was associated and acquainted with talk about it. It was not a matter that was kept secret,-it was a matter that was talked of there freely.</answer>

  <question>Well now you have mentioned two men,- E Cahoon and Young as being parties whom you heard speak of this doctrine?</question>
  <answer>yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>458</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now can you mention any other?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I could mention the whole community if I could think of their names, but there was but very few stayed where I did at the time in that community at that time.-</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>459</questionnumber>
  <question>Stayed where you did,-what do you mean by that?</question>
  <answer>I meant to say that there was but few that stood where I did in the repudiation of that doctrine, for I repudiated it and would not have anything to do with it whatever.</answer>

  <answer>In the winter of 1846.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>477</questionnumber>
  <question>You have said that you did not know of any endowments being practiced prior to that time have you not?</question>
  <answer>I said I did not know of any endowments in the old church but the endowments at Kirtland temple, for they had an endowment that at one time, and I know of no other endowment that was ever practiced in the church except the endowment at Kirtland temple after, - I mean at the temple at Nauvoo, after the death of Joseph Smith. That is what I said I think, and if I did not say it, that is what I intended to say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>478</questionnumber>
  <question>How can you say that the endowments that were practiced in 1845 and 1846 had not been practiced in 1844?</question>
  <answer>Because I know nothing of it in 1844 but I did in ?46.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>479</questionnumber>
  <question>And that is the only reason why you say it was not practiced in 1844</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>480</questionnumber>
  <question>Because you had not heard of it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and I will say that I think it could not have been practiced without my hearing of it. I never heard it, and I think I should have known of it if I had heard of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>481</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there any record of these endowments that were practiced in Kirtland?</question>
  <answer>There is no record that I know anything of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>482</questionnumber>
  <question>And so you did not know of nor hear of any endowment that was practiced in the church from the time of the endowments at Kirtland until the time of the Nauvoo endowments?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not know of any endowments being practiced in the church before the time of the Kirtland endowments, until the time that the endowments were practiced at Nauvoo, after the death of Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>483</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you say that the endowments were practiced in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>
    That was in the winter of 1846 that they were practiced there.

    </pagenumber>That is when they were practiced there in Nauvoo.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>484</questionnumber>
  <question>Can you say also on the same principle that any one practiced polygamy in Nauvoo in 1845?</question>
  <answer>Until 1845?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>485</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if you could say from the same principle that any one practiced polygamy in Nauvoo in the year 1845?</question>
  <answer>In the fall of 1845, - the winter of 1845 I believe it was, but there was a few of them practicing polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>486</questionnumber>
  <question>You know that to be a fact?</question>
  <answer>I have the best reason in the world to believe that it is a fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>487</questionnumber>
  <question>Could you say as a matter of fact that they had not been practicing it long prior to that time?</question>
  <answer>I could not say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>488</questionnumber>
  <question>Well would you say that they had not been practicing it long prior to that time?</question>
  <answer>I say I couldn't say for if they had been at it before that time it was done on the sly and was not openly and publicly advocated as a public doctrine.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>489</questionnumber>
  <question>Then what you mean to say is that polygamy was not advocated publicly, prior to the fall of 1845?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>490</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what you mean to say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>491</questionnumber>
  <question>Now do you mean to say that it was not practiced privately, by the head men of the church prior to that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I mean to say that I don't believe it was. I don't believe it would be so and I not have heard of it, but if it was it was done mighty sly, and they took might good care to keep it secret, - and not let it get out, but I don't believe there is anything in that. I know I never heard of it before 1845 and way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>492</questionnumber>
  <question>And you say the same with reference to the endowments if they were practiced in the church prior to 1845?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>493</questionnumber>
  <question>Would you have heard of the endowments also if they had been practiced in the church prior to the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think I would.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>494</questionnumber>
  <question>And what you say is that you did not hear of them before that time?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I believe they were not practiced until then either.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>495</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it not publicly known that you were opposed to these principles or practices?</question>
  <answer>It could not have been known for I had not heard anything of it until that time, therefore it could not be known how I felt about it as there was no occasion for me to express myself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>496</questionnumber>
  <question>Well at the time it was first talked about it was well known that you were opposed to them was it not?</question>
  <answer>In 1846 - it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>497</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it not also known prior to that time that you were opposed to it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, for I did not know anything about it. I never heard of these things until in 1846 or just previous to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>498</questionnumber>
  <question>You cannot say either that it was not practiced prior to 1844 privately and extensively?</question>
  <answer>No sir I cannot say as to that for I don't know, and I don't believe that it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>499</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you know anything about Bennett's secret wife system?</question>
  <answer>Bennet's?</answer>

  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well no, - I don't know anything about his secret wife system?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>501</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you don't know anything about that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>502</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever hear it spoken of there in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never heard of a secret wife system.</answer>

    </pagenumber>of sealing in the temple, - sealing man and wife.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>504</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever hear of any secret wife system prior to 1844?</question>
  <answer>I think it was early in 1845 that John C Bennett was expelled from the church there on a complaint of intimacy with a woman, and he then turned a persecutor of the church, and wrote a pamphlet in opposition to the church, demeaning the church, etc.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>505</questionnumber>
  <question>He wrote a pamphlet against the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and there was one sent against him in reply I think. It was not particularly on the spiritual wife doctrine, but it was on account of John C Bennet's conduct with a certain lady, and that circumstance created quite a stir for Mr Bennett was quite a conspicuous character in Nauvoo at that time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>506</questionnumber>
  <question>What was it created the stir?</question>
  <answer>His expulsion from the church and that was for the reason of is conduct with this woman, and that matter created a great deal of comment in the church on account chiefly of the conspicuous place that Mr. Bennett occupied in the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>507</questionnumber>
  <question>Now in what year was that?</question>
  <answer>That was I think early in 1845.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>508</questionnumber>
  <question>How long, with reference to that time was it, before you heard of the doctrine of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>It was quite a while, - I can't say just how long it was, but it was quite a while.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>509</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about how long was it afterwards before you heard the question of polygamy talked of or agitated in the church?</question>
  <answer>Well as I say I could not state the time exactly, but it was nearly a year after that. It was nearly or quit e a year after that before I heard any thing about polygamy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>510</questionnumber>
  <question>Nearly a year after this trouble with Bennett?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, about that time I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>511</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the definite cause of that trouble?</question>
  <answer>Well that trouble with Bennett was cause by his living in a house with a woman by the name of Mrs. Orson Pratt. They accused him of undue intimacy with Mrs Pratt, and there was quite a row among the dignaries. I can't recollect just how it all was, but any way the up show of it was that he was turned out of the church, and after he was out of the church in revenge I suppose he turned around and wrote against the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>512</questionnumber>
  <question>Who did you say this woman was that he was accused of being unduly intimately with?</question>
  <answer>Mrs Orson Pratt.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>513</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that Orson Pratt's wife?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>514</questionnumber>
  <question>Where was Pratt at that time?</question>
  <answer>He was in England.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>515</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember about the time of the destruction of the Expositor?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>516</questionnumber>
  <question>You remember that circumstance?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>517</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when would you place that date?</question>
  <answer>of the destruction of that paper, or its office?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>518</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Well that was but a short time I think before Smith's death. That was in 1843 I think or probably in the early part of 1844. Now as I said before with reference to these dates. It is something I can't remember, and I only give the dates as nearly as I can remember.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>519</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about how long before his death was it?</question>
  <answer>I can't say, but my impression is that it was only a short time before it. He was the Mayor of the city at the time it occured, - that is at the time of the destruction of the Expositior.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>520</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Do you remember anything about the reason the Expositior was destroyed?

  <question>I will read as follows, - "The May term of the Circuit Court of this county closed on the 30th ultimo, after a session of ten days. We understand that a large number of cases were disposed of, none however of a very important character. The cases wherein Joseph Smith was a party, were transferred by a change of venue to tother courts; That of a Sampson ys J Smith, for false imprisonment to Adams County; that of F.M. Higbee vs Jodeph Smith for slander, and that of C.A. Foster, vs Joseph Smith and J.W. Coolide for false imprisonment, and that of A. Davis vs Joseph Smith and J.P. Green, for trespass, were all transferred to the county of McDonough. The grand jury bound two billd against Joseph Smith, one for perjury and another for fornication and adultery; on the first of which Smith delivered himself up for trial, but the state not being ready, material witnesses being absent, was deferred to the October term. "Now do you remember of ever seeing, or hearing of that publication?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question, asked the witness for the reasons above set forth.</mono>
  <answer>I recollect something about the circumstances mentioned there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>590</questionnumber>

  <question>Do you recollect of seeing or hearing about that time, an affidavit of the following purport?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr Kelley, - "We object to the answer of the witness and move the court to strike the whole of it from the record on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial to any of the issues in this case, and there is no foundation laid for the introduction of the paper or any pat thereof from which counsel for the defendant has read an extract, and proposes to read further to the witness." By Mr Southern, -</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>592</questionnumber>
  <question>Here is what I propose to read to you, - "I hereby certify that Hyrum Smith did (in his office), read to me a certain written document which he said was a revelation from God, he said that he was with Joseph when it was received. He afterwards gave me the document to read, and I took it to my house, and read it, and showed it to my wife, and returned it next day. The revelation (so called) authorized certain men to have more wives than one at a time, in this world and in the world to come. It said this was the law, and commanded Joseph to enter into the law. And also that he should administer to others. Several other times were in the revelation supporting the above doctrines, " signed "Wm Law". Now I am not asking you whether what I have read is true or not, but whether you ever knew of an affidavit of this purport at the time spoken of?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason "that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and for the further reason that it is not cross examination and the paper from which the alleged revelation has been read has not been identified, nor has the affidavit been identified by the witness."</mono>

  <question>Now did you ever hear, at or about that time, of the charge made in this affidavit which I have read?</question>

  <answer>I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>595</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know anything about that?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that that was one of the identical things that caused them to declare it a nuisance, and I don't know that it was declared a nuisance on any specific ground, but I know that the city council did declare it a nuisance and it was destroyed, but in which direction, or how many directions it was deemed a nuisance I don't know anything about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>596</questionnumber>
  <question>Well will you tell me some of the directions in which it was declared a nuisance?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question for the reasons above set forth.</mono>

  <answer>I said that I might have seen it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>600</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what do you say about it now?</question>
  <answer>I say now that I might have seen it. It is probable that I did see it, and it is possible that I might have read something in it at that time, - it is possible that I did, but if I did I don't remember, as I did not pay much attention to it, but there is no doubt of the fact that I saw that paper before to day.</answer>

  <answer>With what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>603</questionnumber>
  <question>With the character of its contents?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I was I think by general conversation. I don't know that I read it at that time but it was something that created a great deal of a stir there at that time it was published, and I think I got more acquainted with its content by general conversation that was going on about it than in any other way. You must remember that there were two parties there in Nauvoo at that time at strife with one another, and they were at each other personally, and in the press and through the courts, and in fact in every way they could.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>604</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you know at that time that the question of plural wives was one of the questions that was agitated?</question>

  <question>You did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I think not.</answer>

  <question>Did you not know that there were charges of adultery being practiced, and charges of a revelation on plural marriage having been received, and that the charge of the practice of plural wifery, were broadly asserted in that paper?</question>
  <answer>I can't say. If I heard of it at that time I don't remember it now.</answer>

    </pagenumber>I don't remember anything about what was in it for I did not pay any attention to it, I don't even remember of reading anything in it, for I made up my mind that it was the out groth (ibid) of the war that was raging there at the time, and so I paid no attention to it.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>608</questionnumber>
  <question>That is what you saw in answer the question I have asked you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>609</questionnumber>
  <question>All these matters were matters that occurred prior to the death of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That is so, but the polygamy that I have testified I heard about was after the death of Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>610</questionnumber>
  <question>You heard about it then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I did after Joseph's death, it was common talk then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>611</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not hear anything of that sort at the time of the destruction of the Expositor?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>612</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you hear of sealing being taught at that time?</question>
  <answer>When?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>613</questionnumber>
  <question>At the time of the destruction of the Expositor?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>614</questionnumber>
  <question>What did you hear about that?</question>
  <answer>I heard of sealing a man up to everlasting life.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>615</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was that at the time of the destruction of the Expositor?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that was in the early days of the church, old Father Smith giving the patriarchial (ibid) blessing, and we called it sealing them up to eternal life, but that was not sealing a mans wife to him, for that was another thing entirely.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>616</questionnumber>
  <question>That was not the same kind of sealing as sealing a mans wife to him?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that matter of sealing a mans wife to him was quite another thing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>617</questionnumber>
  <question>So then I understand you to testify here, that at about the time of the destruction of the Expositor, and prior to the time of the death of Joseph Smith, you never heard any charge made against him, or against any one else, in the church with reference to polygamy?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>618</questionnumber>
  <question>You never did?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't know that I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>619</questionnumber>
  <question>Now with reference to plural marriage?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not to my remembrance I did not, I don't remember of ever hearing anything of the kind, and I think If I had heard it I would have remembered it. Now there was a good deal of surmising going on, and some talk too in certain quarters but I paid no attention to it though.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>620</questionnumber>
  <question>Where was that going on?</question>
  <answer>Oh in certain places</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>621</questionnumber>
  <question>Well state some of the places?</question>
  <answer>Oh in certain places before there were two parties there and they were abusing each other, and I had my confidence with the party that remained with the church, and I did not have a bit of confidence in the party that dissented fro the church. Now I may be predujiced (ibid) or whatever you choose to call it, but I reposed my confidence in Mr. Smith and the party that stood by him, and so I paid no attention to what this other party said for I know right wall that they would not stop at anything to attain their end which I verily believe was the ruin of the church, and they cam pretty near succeeding in their design too as it turned out. Mr. Smith had my confidence then, and the party that were with him as they have it now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>622</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you say there was surmisings prior to his death?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Yes sir there was, and clear back in the origin of his history there was.</answer>

  <question>What were these surmises that caused trouble in Kirtland?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason that it is not cross examination, and is irrelevant and immeterial, and calls for an opinion of the witness, and hearsay testimony.</mono>
  <answer>Oh different things, -some of the people were not satisfied with their position in the church and others were not satisfied with the doctrine and so forth. There was dissatisfaction there at that time for five of the quarom of Twelve apostatised at one time and left the church, but it survived it as it has survived greater troubles and perils.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>626</questionnumber>
  <question>What were these surmises concerning?</question>
  <answer>Different things.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>627</questionnumber>
  <question>Well state them?</question>
  <answer>I couldn't state all of them.</answer>

  <question>Well state some of them?</question>
  <answer>Well I can't say that I can state secifically what it was only it was finding fault with this and that. They left the church but they claimed to be good church people never the less for they were good religious people, or claimed to be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>629</questionnumber>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons above set forth.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>633</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they surmise that he had doctrines which he taught to some that were not taught publicly?</question>
  <answer>They persucted him principally as I got the idea, because of his personal actions, and the people, or some of them were dis-satisfied with hid dignity, and they dissented from it, and were disfellowshiped.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>634</questionnumber>
  <question>I will ask you this question, -were there any surmisings with reference to his relations with other mens wives?</question>

  <question>That was the Law occurence?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I have told you that four or five times, and I am not sitting here to be made a fool of either.</answer>

  <question>Now what made you say in your examination in chief that you had never heard of these things prior to the death of Joseph Smith?</question>

  <question>Do you remember of the doctrine, - ?</question>
  <answer>I would not like to state the reason that I do not remember anything definite between the contending parties, or between the disputing parties there at that time, as there was quite a while that there was a contest over these things existing between Bennett and contest between strong contesting forces against each other, and the contest was once over different strains, - that is on different subjects.</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>700</questionnumber>
  <question>Was he a polygamist at the time you united with his church?</question>
  <answer>Well there was nothing of that kind made manifest at the time that I joined his church, but it was soon after developed to that effect.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>701</questionnumber>
  <question>How long after you joined his church was it that it was developed to that effect?</question>
  <answer>Well it was not very long.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>702</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about how long?</question>
  <answer>Well not very long, some four or five months.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>703</questionnumber>
  <question>How long did you stay with him after that became manifest?</question>
  <answer>Well I remained with him something like three or four months, when I became satisfied that I was not in the right place.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>704</questionnumber>
  <question>What relation did you bear to Mr Strang and his church?</question>
  <answer>In what way do you mean?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>705</questionnumber>
  <question>What official relation did you bear to Mr Strang and his church?</question>
  <answer>Well I was a member of the church. - I was an elder when I went there. I was an elder in the original church, and I claimed that my eldership was continued in Strang who was perpetuating the church, for I went there believing that Strang was the legal successor of Joseph Smith, and after I got there he introduced this covenant, and I was chosen by Mr Strang as one of the privy council under that covenant.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>706</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was your connection with Mr Strang and his church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that was my connection with Mr Strang's church, and I remained there with them some few months, and when I saw how things were going I rejected him and his church, - I threw up the sponge so to speak and exposed his covenant, and had it published.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>707</questionnumber>
  <question>Now what led you to follow Mr Strang as the successor of Mr Smith?</question>
  <answer>What made me?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>708</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir what led you to do that, or what made you do it?</question>
  <answer>I believe sir that the church was built up by apostles and prophets, and I believed that if Joseph Smith was to have a successor, I believed he had the power to appoint one in his place to act in his place if he were taken away, and Strang claimed the appointment directly from Joseph Smith, and I believed him and thought it was a pretty good thing, so I went with him, believeing that he was the legal successor of Joseph to the Presidency of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>709</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the reason you followed Strang?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir that was my reason, and I believe that a great many felt the same way, for there was a great many felt the same way and followed him, as I did, but when their eyes were open they did not all reject him as I did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>710</questionnumber>
  <question>You believed that he was the successor in what way?</question>
  <answer>I believe that he was the successor to old Joseph Smith, - the original Joseph by an appointment from Joseph himself. I believed that was the doctrine of the church as set forth in the book of doctrine and covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>711</questionnumber>
  <question>Are you not mistaken about that being the doctrine in the Doctrine and Covenants?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I believe this, - that if Joseph appointed him as Strange claimed to have been appointed that Joseph was very much mistaken in the man. I know that the book Covenants gave Joseph the power to appoint one in his place. There is no use asking me questions about that for you are as well aware of it as if you asked me one thousand question on that point.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>712</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know or are you aware, upon what that claim of Strangs to be the successor of Joseph Smith was based?</question>
  <answer>
    Why nothing more than that he was appointed to be the successor of Joseph Smith to the

    </pagenumber>Presidency of the church, and that he was so appointed by Joseph Smith to succeed him when he passed away.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>713</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your understanding of the way that Strang was appointed?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>714</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know upon what basis that appointment was based, - that is do you know whether it was a written appointment or a verbal appointment?</question>
  <answer>It was in a written letter from Joseph Smith to Strang.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>715</questionnumber>
  <question>Did Joseph Smith write such a letter to Strang?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't think he ever did I think it was a forged letter, and proved to be so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>716</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your opinion is it not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I don't think there is the least doubt in the world but that it is correct.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>717</questionnumber>
  <question>You think that it was a forged letter?</question>
  <answer>I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>718</questionnumber>
  <question>That was a letter that purported to have been written by Joseph Smith to Strang appointing him as his successor in the Presidency of the church?</question>
  <answer>That is what it claimed to be according to my understanding of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>719</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see that letter?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I ever have.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>720</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't think I ever did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>721</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever see a copy of that letter?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I ever did. I don't remember, - If I did I don't remember it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>722</questionnumber>
  <question>Then if you followed Mr Strang up there to Wisconsin, hearing that he had been appointed by a letter of appointment, why did you not call for Strang's appointment before you accepted him?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not cross examination, and for the reason that it calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>Well he produced this letter to the hull world, showing his appointment as he claimed it. He did not make any secret of it, for he had his advocates a round to advocate his appointment, and I believed them, I had no reason to doubt them for the church had to have its head, - its prophets, seer and revelator, who would be the President of the church, and I accepted his claim, for I had no reason then no doubt it, and we were disgusted with the church there at Nauvoo, with its organization and the actions of the twelve that they had there, or the remnants of the original twelve. I know I was disgusted with Brigham Young and the set that were backing him there at Nauvoo, and so I joined Strang's organization but the result proved that I was only jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. That is all there was to that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>723</questionnumber>
  <question>You have stated that you thought, - that you afterwards concluded that letter was a forgery?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>724</questionnumber>
  <question>What made you arrive at that conclusion?</question>
  <answer>Well I think that was satisfactorily proven.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>725</questionnumber>
  <question>Of course you base your change of opinion upon testimony, now will you be kind enough to state what testimony was that forced you to the conclusion that that letter was a forgery?</question>
  <answer>Well from an examination I made myself, I found out that he was not the man and did not fill the bill, and I believed then as I do now that he was an imposter. It was a forged letter, and was forged for that purpose.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>726</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that the reason yiu thought the letter was forged, because he did not fill the bill?</question>
  <answer>Well that was not all the reasons, we had plenty of reasons</answer>

  </pagenumber>
  
  <questionnumber>727</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what were they?</question>
  <answer>We had plenty of reasons that I can't now detail. We were satisfied then that he was an impster and proved to be an imposter.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>728</questionnumber>
  <question>How long since that time?</question>
  <answer>Since what time?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>729</questionnumber>
  <question>What year was that?</question>
  <answer>I told you that I went to Strang in 1842.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>730</questionnumber>
  <question>In what year, - what time in the year?</question>
  <answer>In 1847. In the spring of that year I joined Strang's church, and I stayed with him about three, four or five months. I don't remember precisely, but about that length of time I remained with him, and then I saw he was not what he pretended to be and I divulged and exposed his covenants and practices, and had it published. I don't remember what time it was that I discontinued fellow ship with him, but I know what I am talking about for Strang was pretty friendly with me until I found out what he was, or he would not have appointed me, as one of his privy council. I know that after that time he was my strong enemy and hunted me pretty close.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>731</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you and he have any falling out?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, and immeterial and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>732</questionnumber>
  <question>In what respect did you disagree?</question>
  <answer>It was so far as we disagred it our methods of proceedure in regard to the membership of the church and the practices he was trying to force upon the church. I felt that I could not fellowship with him as a Christian for many reasons.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>733</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you were looking for a church the President of which had been appointed by Joseph the seer as you called him, - when you went to Strang?</question>
  <answer>Y I was, and when I went to Strang I supposed that he filled the bill, and that Joseph Smith had really appointed him as his successor.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>734</questionnumber>
  <question>Well will you answer my question?</question>
  <answer>I thought I did.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons about set forth.</mono>
  <answer>I believed that I was going to the original church which I belonged to, believing that Mr Strang had been appointed by Joseph Smith as his successor, and that Strang was then the head of the church by appointment.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>737</questionnumber>
  <question>By appointment of Joseph Smith?</question>

  <question>And then you thought you had found that church, the true church, that had not been rejected, but afterwards you found out that you were mistaken. Is that it?</question>

  <answer>Well sir I professed my readings to endorse the reorganization to be the true church and I was baptized by one of the apostled into the church. I felt like renewing my covenant in the work of the church, and upon my application and so professing and accepting the church as the true church, I was received upon it as being baptized.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>821</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they assign you any work as an elder?</question>
  <answer>No sir I am no preacher.</answer>

  <question>You were baptized into the original church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>826</questionnumber>
  <question>Then why was it necessary to be re-baptized into the reorganized church?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I told you that I merely renewed my covenant with the church. I had wandered from the path of the true faith by joining Strang's church, and I felt as did the reorganized church that it was necessary for me to renew my covenant with the faith and in order to do that it was necessary to be baptized anew. I felt the necessity of this myself, and so it was done.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>827</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now answer me this question, - is it not a fact that you lost your eldership by reason of your connection with Strang?</question>
  <answer>It was just this way, - it was my wish to have my eldership renewed, - at least they told me that that could be done, but I told them that I did not want it, but I was confirmed a member of the church but not an elder that is I was not formally confirmed as an elder, but I still consider that I am one, for if by my rebaptism and renewal of my covenants in that way with the church I am reinstated as a member, I consider that that carried everything with it and I am reinstated precisely in the same condition and with the same offices that I held before I fell away from the church, if I did fall away.</answer>

  <question>You did not?</question>
  <answer>
    No sir, I never saw any of his plates, but I saw the old brass kettle that the woman said it was cut out of. These plates that he had had became tarnished so I hear, and that was one evidence to me and many others, that his plates were now that he represented them to be, or they would not have rusted, and his plates

  <question>What was that about the lady?</question>

  <answer>It was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>835</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you observe it closely enough to see how thick the plates would be that were cut out of it?</question>
  <answer>Well I was not specially particular to examine it to see just how think the plates would be that were cut out of it, but it was an ordinary small sized brass kettle. This lady tho - told me about it said that they had cut out several pieces and it did not please them, and they cut on again and kept on cutting until they got some pieces that suited them.</answer>

  <question>When did you see this kettle?</question>

  <questionnumber>840</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you look at it to see how thick the plates must be?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't know that I did particularly, but it was just an old ordinary brass kettle, - not very thick, just an old ordinary brass kettle like they used to have in those days.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>841</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about how thick must it have been?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question sked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I say I don't know that I can tell you particularly but I do not think it was very thick. I did not observe it close enough to observe, - that is to say I did not have that in my mind at the time, and so I paid no attention particularly to the thickness of it.</answer>

  <question>Would you know whether they were of metal similiar to the kettle out of which they were said to have been taken, if you were to see them?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not say - that I could. I rather think I could not, but if I were to see them I rather think I could judge pretty well with reference to their thickness as compared with the thickness of the kettle.</answer>

  <questionnumber>886</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you are confident that you read it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir and I believe that it was introductory to what came afterwards and a kind of a feeler, - that is what I believe about it, for this sister who gave me the book was pretty puch interested in it, and she was afterwards appointed to hold meetings and instruct the younger sisters as to the duties of wives toward their husbands, and she had these books for their benefits.</answer>

  <question>Do you know how the sisters obtained the books?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>891</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know anything about that?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't know that I do know anything positively.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>892</questionnumber>
  <question>Did she tell you how she obtained hers?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't recollect that she did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>893</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you have any conversation with her about the book?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir we talked about it a great deal, and she was of the same opinion I was, and always remained of the same opinion. She left the church there at Nauvoo disgusted with their practices, and moved to Rock Island.</answer>

  <questionnumber>894</questionnumber>
  <question>What became of her after that?</question>
  <answer>Well she died there I understand. I was well acquainted with her, - she was a good friend of mine, but she did not leave the church there at Nauvoo at the same time I did. She remained with it and went through with all their ceremonies and endowments, she went clear through the temple was present at a great many of their sealing ceremonies, and she afterwards told me all about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>895</questionnumber>
  <question>She got the endowments?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. She went through with all those endowments and sealings ceremonies there at Nauvoo and she afterwards told me all about it and she was a truthful woman and I believed she told me the truth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>896</questionnumber>
  <question>You say that she told you the truth?</question>
  <answer>I believe she did, and what I saw myself corroborated what she told me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>897</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you say that all these things occured at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>898</questionnumber>
  <question>Before 1846 did you say?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>899</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you say that all these things occurred at Nauvoo? before 1846?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. It was before that. It was during the fall of 1845 I think and the winter of 1845 and 1846 I am not very greatly mistaken. It was before they commenced to leave Nauvoo, and they began their emigration in 1846.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>900</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the time of the endowments?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir the endowment was then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>901</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember what was the date of the book that you saw?</question>
  <answer>The date of the book - that that lady gave me to read, - is that what you want?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>902</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't remember.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>903</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not remember who were the authors of the book?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>904</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there anything in the book to indicate who was the author of authors of the book?</question>
  <answer>No sir I don't remember that there was. It was just called "Father Jacob's" writings. That was all that I remember about that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>905</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know where it was printed?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>906</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not pay anu attention to that either?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not bother about that. It was an obsene book, and I paid no-attention to who wrote it, or where it was published or anything of the kind.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>907</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know where there was a copy of it?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I was furnished a copy of it, and that is all I know about it. As I have already stated it was a very obsene book. That is a hard remark to make use about anything, but at the same time that is the truth for it was a very obsene dirty book.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>908</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you say that book was circulated in that church there at Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was circulated principally as I understand it amongst the female members of the church there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>909</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was before you left was it not?</question>
  <answer>Before I left what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>910</questionnumber>
  <question>Before you left Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I lived in Nauvoo at the time it was circulated, for that is the place I seen it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>911</questionnumber>
  <question>Was this book an authority amongst the seventy then to which you belonged?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immeterial, and not cross examination.</mono>

  </pagenumber>
  <answer>No, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>912</questionnumber>
  <question>It was not an authority in your quorom then?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not that I know anything of. It was never presented in my quorom that I ever heard anything of at all. It certainly was not presented while I remained a member of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>913</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you, and I believe you did not answer me with reference as to whether you knew where there was another copy of that book?</question>
  <answer>Whether there is, - where there is what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>914</questionnumber>
  <question>Whether you know where there is a copy of that book.</question>
  <answer>No sir I do not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>915</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you ever seen a copy of it since that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir I have never seen another copy of it since that time, - that is all that I ever saw about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>916</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you have stated that you knew what the doctrine of the church were at that time you became a member of it, and up to 1844?</question>
  <answer>I said so sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>917</questionnumber>
  <question>And now I will ask you what were the doctrines of the church between 1844 and 1847 at Nauvoo, and at other places?</question>
  <answer>Well the doctrines of the church were never altered in the book of Doctrine and Covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>918</questionnumber>
  <question>Then the doctrines of the church remained the same?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir the doctrines of the church are the same as far as that is concerned, but the practices of the church were the very reverse of what the doctrines were, for they cut loose from the Doctrine and Covenants, and did not recognize it, and they made a whole lot of secret work that they were practicing that was not authorized by the book of Doctrine and Covenant nor anything else that I knw of that was authority in the church before the death of Joseph Smith.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>919</questionnumber>
  <question>So then I understand that you testify that the doctrines of the church were the same from 1844 to 1847 that they had been before 1844? Is that what I understand you to swear to?</question>
  <answer>I have no other answer to make further than I have, and that is that the doctrines of the church were the same as far as I understand it, but the practices of the church were vastly different. The doctrines of the church for that matter are the same now as they always have been.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>920</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you mean by the phrase "the church" in the answer that you have given to my question?</question>
  <answer>I mean what I say, - the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>921</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you mean by the term "the church", explain what you mean by "church"?</question>
  <answer>I mean the same church that exists today, - that it was the same church or is the same church today that it was before the death of Joseph Smith. It sustains the same doctrines, and the fellowship of the same book as it did at the time of the origin of the church. It is not dead, but still lives.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>922</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you mean the church that was organized by the apostles away back at the Pentecost, - do you mean the church that has existed from that time down to the present?</question>
  <answer>I mean the church that Joseph Smith organized, and it was organized under the doctrine of the original church that is what I believe.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>923</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then I would be glad as you have state, what the doctrines of the original church were, and as you say they were the same from 1844 to 1847 save and except the matter of their practices?</question>
  <answer>Well the practices did not change the order with me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>924</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Do you undertake to say now there, that whilst there was only one in ten like yourself at Nauvoo, that rejected these practices and that the others all practiced a thing they did not teach

    </pagenumber>that thing while nine tenth of the church were practicing it?
  </question>
  <answer>I did not say so sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>925</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not say that?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>926</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will ask you if they did so?</question>
  <answer>I did not say any such a thing, and I don't believe there was over our fourth of the population that went into this thing. 927 (Mistakenly listed at number 827)</answer>
  <question>What thing?</question>
  <answer>This thing called polygamy. I don't believe there was over one fourth of the people that belonged to the church at the time of the death of Joseph Smith that went into this thing. I don't believe that one fourth of the membership of the church took hold of that doctrine that they established and tent into it and practiced it. They proceeded and established that practice because the leaders of the church were in favor of it, and they used the power they had in their hands to established it in the way they did, but they did not get any great number of the total membership of the church to back them up in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>928</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do I understand you to say that they practiced something that was contrary to the doctrines of the church they preached between 1844 and 1847?</question>
  <answer>After Joseph Smith's death Brigham Young was sustained as the leader and President of the church, he and his two-counsellors constituting the first Presidency of the church, and they proceeded to teach that the book of covenants was of no value to the church, - the book of covenants as they put it was like a steam boat that had gone up the river, - that was the illustration that was made. They were required to live by the living oracles, and pay no attention to the dead ones as they put it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>929</questionnumber>
  <question>Well state how you know they taught it that way?</question>
  <answer>I know it sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>930</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how do you know it?</question>
  <answer>I heard them do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>931</questionnumber>
  <question>Well who did you hear?</question>
  <answer>I heard them, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>932</questionnumber>
  <question>You heard them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>933</questionnumber>
  <question>Well who did you hear preach that?</question>
  <answer>I heard Orson Hyde preach that in the assembly hall to the seventy.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>934</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you one of the seventy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>935</questionnumber>
  <question>Well who else preached it?</question>
  <answer>Oh I can't say, but it was a common thing to hear that preached, - that they were to obey the councel of the leaders of the church, and not pay any more attention to the book of covenants. 936 (Mistakenly listed as number 934)</answer>
  <question>After you first heard these doctrines preached that you refer to in the seventy, did you still remain with that seventy and act with it long enough to hear all these doctrines preached by others to the seventy, - I mean these doctrines that you would not accept and rejected?</question>
  <answer>No sir now after I was asked that question as to whether I would preach and teach the doctrine of plural wifery in case I was sent out to preach, and then I stated that I would not and that I could not fellowship with them any longer if they taught anything like that in the church. I told them that I could not fellowship with them in my quorom, and that I could not preach that doctrine if I was sent out, for that was the question that was asked me. 937 (Mistakenly listed as number 935)</answer>
  <question>Now you have given as you have stated here, what was the doctrine of the church after 1844?</question>
  <answer>Well I did not say it was the doctrine of the church. 938 (Mistakenly listed as number 936)</answer>
  <question>Well they have taught, - they did teach as you stated it, that the book of doctrine and covenants was not an authority any longer in the church, but that the doctrine of the church came directly through them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <questionnumber>937</questionnumber>
  <question>Now how many of them did you hear that taught that?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, and immeterial and no cross examination, and a repetition of matter already enquired into.</mono>
  <answer>I think I have answered that question as well as I can answer it. I don't know that I have anything more to add to what I have already stated.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>938</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you have mentioned one name?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>939</questionnumber>
  <question>The name of Orson Hyde?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>940</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you mention another?</question>
  <answer>Another name, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>941</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir the name of another man their you heard preach or teach that doctrine?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>942</questionnumber>
  <question>Whom you heard preach that doctrine that you have referred to?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know that I can particularly, but I know that I have heard it preached from the stand more than twenty times.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>943</questionnumber>
  <question>Where?</question>
  <answer>Right there in Nauvoo. It was to be counselled by your file leaders, - that was the principle doctrine that was taught and it was very earnestly taught too.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>944</questionnumber>
  <question>Well no Mr Griffits in the doctrine of revelation through these file leaders as you call them, be true why does it not follow that what they taught you to-follow as doctrine is also true?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons above set forth, and for the additional reason that it calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>Well I don't see that that would follow of necessity. I think it is a matter where every body would think for himself, and that under the rules and doctrines of the church we were not bound to accept anything that came in that way as the doctrine of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>945</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then Mr Griffith if men are or were authorized to give revelations that have in the proper course become a part of the book of doctrine and covenants, why are they not authorized to give revelations or receive them after the book of doctrine and covenants is tsais made?</question>
  <answer>For the best reason in the world, - for the reason that God does not contradict himself, and these revelations or rather doctrines or practices that they attempts to force upon the church were and are directly contradictory to the book of covenants, and if they had come from God he would be contradicting himself, which he never does, therefore we know that they were not of God, and they had no authority to give them to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>946</questionnumber>
  <question>Well if at one time they were authorized to give revelations that were to go into the book of Doctrine nd Covenants, what takes away that right after the book of doctrine and covenants was made?</question>
  <answer>Well the question with us, and the question at issue today is, has the Twelve a right to give revelations that are contradictory to the revelations that are in the book of Doctrine and Covenants which we know is from God. That is the question sir, and I say that these revelations that they gave authorizing these practices were directly at variance with the revelations in the book of Doctrine and Covenants that came from God through Joseph Smith, the prophet, seer and revelator. They taught a new theory of things, and taught that which the book of doctrine and covenants did not teach, and consequently they did not endorse it.</answer>

  <questionnumber>954</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not know that to be the fact,-you have not positive knowledge on that point?</question>
  <answer>No sir that is not my positive knowledge that is I have not any knowledge that would amount to positive proof on that point, but that is my opinion, and I base that opinion upon my observation and reading that book of Father Jacobs, and from the known in ability of Brigham Young to-establish any such an institution, and Parley Pratt and Williard Richards know ability and inclination to do, therefore I laid it to them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>955</questionnumber>
  <question>Is this your reasoning,-because they were able to do a thing of that sort, therefore they did it?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons that it is not proper cross examination, and is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir I gave you my reasons, but recollect I did not say I knew it, for I don't know it of my own positive knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>956</questionnumber>
  <question>When you heard that doctrine taught as you say you did, and for the teaching of which you say you left the church at Nauvoo; were, or were you not taught at the same time, that the doctrine originated with Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>957</questionnumber>
  <question>I asked you if you were not taught at the same time that that doctrine was taught you there at Nauvoo, and for the teaching if which you left the church at that time, originated with Joseph Smith?</question>
  <answer>It was rumored sir that Joseph Smith had such a revelation, but I never found the man that had seen it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>958</questionnumber>
  <question>Now when you heard the doctrine taught in the quorum of seventy did you not always or at the same time that you heard it taught, did you not hear it also taught, that the doctrine at the back of it had the authority of Joseph Smith?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons above set forth.</mono>

    </pagenumber>they told you at the time that it was the doctrine given by Joseph Smith through a revelation?
  </question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetetn, irrelevant and immeterial, and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Well of course the Brighamites when they were teaching that doctrine attempted to carry the idea that it was a revelation from Joseph Smith, but I never believed it there was a great many stood with me in that position, for I was not alone by any means in that opinion.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>960</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they not state that when you first heard of it?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>961</questionnumber>
  <question>Did they not make that statement when you first heard of it?</question>
  <answer>Brigham Young I think stated that the original of it had been burned up, and that he had a copy of it, but we did not know whether or not it was a copy, or that there had ever been an original.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>962</questionnumber>
  <question>Well will you answer my question?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I have answered it. I say that I don't believe that Joseph Smith ever had any such a revelation or that there ever was any such an original. I believe that that revelation was forged after Joseph Smith's death, and that he never had any such a revelation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>963</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when you first began to hear of it as you have testified here, did they not also at that time begin also to teach that it was authorized through a revelation from Joseph Smith?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons above set forth, and on the ground that it is a repetition of matter already fully enquired into.</mono>
  <answer>Of course, I say that they claimed that it was in accordance with a a revelation that Joseph Smith had received, but no body ever saw the original that I ever head of or saw.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>964</questionnumber>
  <question>Then they made some efforts to sustain the theory that Joseph Smith was the author of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but there was a great many did not believe them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>965</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe you stated that you never took any of the endowments?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not take any of their endowments.</answer>

  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>968</questionnumber>
  <question>Were there rooms there, - was the temple arranged for the giving of the endowments?</question>
  <answer>They did not have the temple completed, but they had rooms in it sufficiently finished to receive their endowments there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>969</questionnumber>
  <question>Then they had rooms in the temple?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, they had rooms there to their satisfaction for that purpose, but none of them were completely finished at that time, or at any other time I understand.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>970</questionnumber>
  <question>Well as there was a room in the temple, why did you not offer yourself there for the purpose of taking the endowments?</question>
  <answer>Because I did not want to.</answer>

  <questionnumber>981</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you were eligible to take the endowments?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I had paid my tithes, and I was notified that I could go through the temple and take the endowment. One of their principal men notified me of that, and I told him I did not want to go through it because I did not have any robes, and they told me that they had robes there, and then I said that I could borrow Porter Rockwell's, - no they said I could borrow his robe if I wanted it, and I said that I did not believe that I could get it, and they thought that it was quite an evidence, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>982</questionnumber>
  <question>Well never mind about what you said and they said, - who was he?</question>
  <answer>Who?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>983</questionnumber>
  <question>Porter Rockwell?</question>
  <answer>Oh he was quite a distinguished fellow there in the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>984</questionnumber>
  <question>Well the fact is that you did not take the endowments?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>985</questionnumber>
  <question>And you did not take them because you did not want to do so?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I concluded that I would have nothing to do with them. That is the reason I would not take them.</answer>

  <questionnumber>988</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you object to taking the blood covenant with Strang?</question>

  <questionnumber>989</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you take it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, but as I say afterwards when I saw what it was I dis-avowed it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>990</questionnumber>
  <question>How long was it after you took it before you disavowed it?</question>
  <answer>Well it was only a short time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>991</questionnumber>
  <question>Well about how long did you live in that covenant before you dis-avowed it?</question>
  <answer>Well I guess it was about two months.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>992</questionnumber>
  <question>Was that not also a secret covenant?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>993</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you take an oath that you would not divulge it also?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I took an oath not to reveal the obligations, I took an oath to obey the rules of that covenant, but as I say when I found just what it was I dis-avowed it and dis-annuled the obligation they had put upon me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>994</questionnumber>
  <question>You kept it while you were there with Strang?</question>
  <answer>No sir I did not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>995</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not?</question>
  <answer>No sir I exposed it at the same place, - right there where Strang was living. I did not do anything behind his back, for what I did was done openly and above board.</answer>

  <answer>Yes sir that is what I did, I exposed it then, and I do so now as far as I remember it. I repudiate it now just the same as I did then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>998</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is the Necessity for you to repudiate that covenant?</question>
  <answer>What is the necessity?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>999</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Because I thought it was my duty to do so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1000</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what moved you to the performance of that which you considered your duty?</question>
  <answer>Well sir because I thought it was entirely derogatory to anything that I thought was even moral. I did not consider that there was anything in it that was consistent with good morals.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1001</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you owe a duty to any one that caused you to make an exposure of that covenant?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that I understand you? What do you mean?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1002</questionnumber>
  <question>I say do you owe anyone a duty that makes it your duty to now expose that covenant, or did you owe anyone such a duty at the time that you exposed it first?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I so considered it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1003</questionnumber>
  <question>To whom did you owe that duty?</question>
  <answer>I owed it as a duty to my father and my friends and neighbors, and all the world to expose it. That was a duty that I considered that I owed to my father, friends and neighbors and sisters and the common wealth.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1004</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the moving cause that impelled you to expose that covenant which you had solemnly obligated yourself to not reveal?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and that was satisfactory to me, and it is a matter of indifference to me whether it is satisfactory to you or not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1005</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you hold that a man may go into a secret obligation, and agree that he will stand by the obligation with other parties, and afterwards he can come out and expose it to all the world?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1006</questionnumber>
  <question>That is your position?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I hold that that is my privilege.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1007</questionnumber>
  <question>What makes you take that position?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I don't believe that any man has a right to bind me up in that way.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1008</questionnumber>
  <question>As you may not have stated it fully, will you be kind enough to now state the particulars of that obligation?</question>
  <answer>Of that obligation?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1009</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, or of that covenant?</question>
  <answer>No sir I could not do it fully but I am informed that there is a covenant here in the house to day, but from recollection I could not state it at this time fully.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1010</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I will withdraw that question, or I do not wish to ask you to reveal a covenant that you took an oath not to reveal, -and which you took in your own blood?</question>
  <answer>Well sir I took it in my own blood and signed my name in blood, and I disavowed the wicked compact and disavowed and dis-annuled it, because I though then, and I am satisfied now that it was a covenant that was of the Evil One, and I should not keep it, and then I did not think it should be countenanced. I took one covenant in my time that I have not divulged, and if I can live up to that I am satisfied, for I know I will be a better man by living up to it, but that was not the case with this covenant that Strang had that I exposed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>1011</questionnumber>
  <question>What is that covenant you refer that you took, and have lived up to?</question>
  <answer>The covenant of the gospel.</answer>

  <questionnumber>16</questionnumber>
  <question>Well state to the reporter what you know about it?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know anything that would be worth telling hardly, - I don't know very much about it that would be worth telling perhaps, - any further than I know that my relatives, - I know my parents and relatives took a very active part in the expelling of the saints, from Independence, and at that time there was no thought that they would ever return again.</answer>

  <answer>My parents?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>20</questionnumber>

  <answer>Just as long as they lived I would hear them occasionally speak of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>21</questionnumber>
  <question>And how long did they live?</question>
  <answer>Well my mother has been dead about three years, and my father about sixteen years. They have been dead that long, -my mother three years, and my father sixteen years, and his brothers died at intervals along from that time to this and all the neighbors that I knew who took part in it have about died since then, - that is, all who acted in the same spirit.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>22</questionnumber>
  <question>What would they say when they referred to it?</question>
  <answer>Well I remember that they would call them liars and thieves and cut-throats, and about everything they could think of that was bad. They would speak of them that way and call them all the bad names they could think of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>23</questionnumber>
  <question>What did they say, or what would they say with reference to their coming back here at any time?</question>

  <questionnumber>24</questionnumber>
  <question>Was this the general talk of the community?</question>
  <answer>
    That was the general talk so far as I know. That was about the way they would speak of them, and I never heard any one speak friendly to them until about the time that I commenced to investigate their

    </pagenumber>doctrine, and then I heard some good things, - or rather I found it out for myself.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>25</questionnumber>
  <question>About what time was that?</question>
  <answer>That was about twelve years ago.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>26</questionnumber>
  <question>How did it come that you investigated the doctrine of the church?</question>
  <answer>My attention was first attracted to it at the time that this brother came out there in our neighborhood, where I was at that time, - he came out there to preach, for he understood there was an opening there where he could do good, and we met there several times to hear him preach. He preached in the school house, but finally they locked the school house and said they were not going to allow him the privilege of preaching in the school house at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>27</questionnumber>
  <question>Up to this time the neighbourhood had been against them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>28</questionnumber>
  <question>And your own relatives amongst the number?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. In all the talk I heard there, and the people that I have heard talk, and I have heard almost every body that lived there at that time talk about it, and I never heard anybody express a friendly word for "the Mormons" as they called them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>29</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you see them at the time they were driven out from here, or were you too young?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I can't remember about that for I was too young. At that time I was only three years old, and I can't remember even how my father and brothers looked as they started out to help the mob tear down the printing office and drive them from the town. I remember that they were in the persecuting party but that is about all I do remember.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>30</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you remember any of the occurences relative to the year 1838?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I remember about that. I remember a good deal about that, but that was not here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what do you recollect about that?</question>
  <answer>I remember that there was a lot of men went under the command of Captain Sanders to Caldwell County to expel and the Latter Day saints from there. I remember that they said they would have to follow them up and kill the last one of them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>32</questionnumber>
  <question>That was in Caldwell County?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was there a company went from here to help expel the saints from Caldwell County?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember any one that went with them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and there is only two men that I know of now that are living who went with them at that time, and one of them is Alexander Harris and the other is Samuel Luttrell.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>35</questionnumber>
  <question>Were any of your relatives with them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>36</questionnumber>
  <question>Who of your relatives were among them?</question>
  <answer>My father and one of his brothers in law, and one of his cousins by the name of Pitcher. At this time this man Pitcher lived out there on the Rock Creek road.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>37</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when they returned did they state that they had driven them out?</question>
  <answer>Well I have heard my father state a good deal about what happened then, but I was only about nine years old, and I do not remember very well what he did state about it, - but I remember very well that they were to be driven away, and not be allowed to come back again. That was the common conversation in the country and there was a few of the Latter Day Saints that wanted to stay for a while and wind up their business, but they would not permit it, - they just drove them right out and would not let them stay at all. That is what they said when they came back, - they drove them right out.</answer>

  <questionnumber>62</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>64</questionnumber>
  <question>Now when did this occur?</question>
  <answer>That was when I was a child.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>65</questionnumber>
  <question>And you remember it to this day?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. It came to be when I was about grown that there was very little said on the subject one way or the other for some time, until the saints commenced collecting back here again.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>66</questionnumber>
  <question>When did they commence collecting back here again?</question>
  <answer>I don't know for I never got acquainted with the doctrines of the church, or heard much said about it until twelve years ago.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>67</questionnumber>
  <question>So then from the time that you were grown up to ten or twelve years ago, you never heard much said about it?</question>
  <answer>No sir for I was not one that went out into society a great deal, and I never saw a great dael in print about it either. The first thing that aroused a conversation in my hearing, after I got to hearing the doctrine preached, was because they were trying to make opposition to my becoming a member of the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>68</questionnumber>
  <question>That was amongst your frienbs?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>69</questionnumber>
  <question>They were opposed to your becoming a member of the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. - it was my friends and neighbors that were opposed to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>70</questionnumber>
  <question>What church did you belong to before that?</question>
  <answer>Before I joined the Latter Day Saints?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>71</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes ma'am?</question>
  <answer>I never belonged to any church in my life, and never heard a doctrine preached that I gave a snap for before that time, and I went to church too ever since I was a little child.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>72</questionnumber>
  <question>Your friends and relatives belonged to other churches</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, to other denominations, - to the christion church, the Methodists, and some to the Cumberland Presbyterians.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>73</questionnumber>
  <question>Now in your time, have you not heard people use the same kind of language towards the Catholics as you say you have heard used against the Latter Day Saints or Mormons?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I have heard the same kind of a spirit expressed towards the Catholics. There was an old lady by the name of Dand, when I first commenced going to the Latter Day Saints' church, told my children if I joined it to disown me, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>74</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was it told your children that?</question>
  <answer>It was old Betsey Land told them that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>75</questionnumber>
  <question>She was a Catholic?</question>
  <answer>No sir, she was a Cumberland Presbyterian. All the neighbors were against it, - against my joining the Latter Day Saints, and did all they could to prevent it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>76</questionnumber>
  <question>The Latter Day Saints were not popular in that neighbourhood?</question>
  <answer>No sir, and it showed that they had the same spirit of indignation towards them that they had in the past.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>77</questionnumber>
  <question>Now in all that time did any body organize a mob to trouble them?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not in this country, but I have heard of their being badly treated in other localities.</answer>

    of the trustees, directors or managers of any benevolent, charitable, literary, scientific, religious or missionary institution under the patronage of any synod, conference or association, or other ecclesiastical body of the state, or two or more of them, said amendment or change may originate with either of said trustees, directors or managers, or with either of the said patronizing bodies, but such change or amendment shall not be made without the vote of a majority of each of said trustees, directors or managers, and of each of the said patronizing bodies, legally expressed and certified thereto by the secretary, clerk, or recording officer of such board of trustees, directors or managers and of each 667 of the patronizing bodies.

Approved March 18th, 1874." Now that embraces all that I believe relates to this case. (The copy of the statutes of Iowa, above described, are marked "Exhibit X, J, M, Orr".) By Mr. E.L. Kelley, - "Let the record show that the plaintiff has permission to put in evidence the certified copy of the articles of incorporation of the Re-organized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, on file in Kendall County, Illinois, at any time before the closing of the testimony for the defendant." By Mr. Southern, - "Yes sir, that is correct, - that is all right." It is agreed and stipulated by and between the parties hereto by their respective attorney's as aforesaid that all the testimony taken is this case may be transcribed and filed by the Notary Public taking the same in shorthand, and who also the Examiner appointed by the Court to take the testimony in the Territory of Utah, at his convenience without reference to the terms of the stipulation entered into heretofore by which it was stipulated that the testimony taken by the parties hereto should be filed by certain specified dates, - provided that the same shall be on file in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court in which this cause is pending before the opening of the September term of said court. (The foregoing stipulation was dictated by Mr. Sothern, Counsel for Defendants.) By Mr. E.L. Kelley, - "I do not know how it will be, but I suppose we have a right to take testimony until the ninth of May, but I don't know that we will avail ourselves of the right, and take any more testimony at this time. I would like to know about the taking of your testimony Mr. Southern, and if it is convenient to you I would like you to defer taking until the first of June or a little later. My brother says that he cannot get here before the first of June, and I have engagements that will take up my time pretty fully until then, therefore I would like to know about when you propose to begin taking testimony, - and I would also like to know in case we deem it advisable to take any further testimony, what time it would be convenient to do so." By Mr. Southern, - "It is agreed that the plaintiff has until the end of May to put in any additional testimony they shall see fir to put in giving us reasonable notice of the time and place of the taking of the same, so we may be on hand." By Mr. Kelley, - "Suppose - we adjourn by agreement to meet on the fifth or sixth." My Mr. Southern, - "Put it the second Monday in May." 668 By Mr. Kelley: Let it be Friday, the sixth of May, so then it will not be necessary to give notice. By Mr. Southern: "Well that is all right. Now if you don't appear here by one o'clock on the 6th you will not be here on that day at all? By Mr. Kelley: I will notify you and the Examiner by telegram or letter in case I am not coming. By Mr. Southern: Very well, the understanding then is is that we adjourn until Friday, the sixth of May. By Mr. Kelley: Yes sir, that is the date. Now, there is one thing i have forgotten. In order to introduce what might be termed secondary evidence, I offer the certificate of the Adjutant General of the State of Missouri, dated April 23, 1892, certifying that the order of Governor Boggs, dated October 27, 1838, expelling of banishing the Mormons from the Stae of Missouri is not to be found among the records of that department, signed by J.A. Wickham, Adjutant General, with the seal of the state, and ask that the same be marked Exhibit "Y" by the Notary Public. Exhibit "Y" above offers in evidence, is in words and figures as follows, to wit.- State of Missouri Adjutant General's Orrice City of Jefferson April 23, 1892 It is hereby certified that the order of Governor Boggs dated October 27, 1838, expelling or banishing the Mormons from the State of Missouri, is not to be found among the records of this department. J.A. Wickham, Adjutant General (Seal of Adjutant General's office) By Mr Kelley: And also in connection with that last offer, I offer in evidence the certificate of the Secretary of State with referece to the Judges of the Courts of Caldwell County, and also a letter from the Secretary of State, and duly signed y hi, showing that no such Order of Governor Boggs exists in the office of the Secretary of State, and ask that the same be marked "Z." Exhibit "Z" above referred to in evidence, is in words and figures as follows, to wit.- State of Missouri Department of State, City of Jefferson April 19, 1892 Dear Sir, Repyling to your of the 18th inst; 1. I am unable to send you a "duly certified copy of the order of Gov. L. W.

No record of that character is on file for either of the years 1833 or 1834, the records up to November 1837 being destroyed by the fire that burned the capitol. 3. I send you a certified copy of the record of the election and appointments of justices of the county court for Caldwell County for the years you request, the state's fee for which is $1.50, which is deducted from your money order, and balance ($1.50) returned herewith.

    </pagenumber>The history of Caldwell and Livingston Counties, Missouri above referred to, the title page of which has just been read by counsel for the plaintiff, and which is given above is marked Exhibit "26". By Mr. Kelley, - "I offer from page one hundred and forty of exhibit 26, the copy of the written speech by General Clarke, delivered to the Mormons at Far West, Missouri, on the Temple Square, - all that part of his speech, or of the contents of that page beginning with the word "gentlemen" on page one hundred and forty, and ending with the words "irretrievably ruined" on page one hundred and forty one. The following is a copy of the above offer from page one hundred and forty of exhibit 26, to wit, - "Gentlemen: You whose names are not attached to this list of names, will not have the privilege's of going to your fields to obtain corn for your families, wood, etc. Those that are now taken will go from thence to prison to be tried, and receive the due de-merit of their crimes; but you are now at liberty, all but such charges as may be here after preferred against you. It now devolves upon you to fulfill the treaty that you have entered into, the leading items of which I now lay before you. The first of these yo you have already complied with, which is, that you deliver up your leading men to be tried according to law. Second, - that you deliver up your arms, - this has been attended to. The third is that you sign over your properties to defray the expenses of this war, - this you have also done. Another thing yet remains for you to comply with, - that is you leave the state forthwith; and whatever your feelings concerning this affair, whatever your innocence, it is nothing to me. Gen Lucas, who is in authority with me, has made this treaty with you. I am determined to see it executed. The orders of the Governor to me were, that you should be exterminated, and not allowed to continue in the state, and had your leaders not been given up, and the treaty complied with before this, you and your families would have been destroyed, and your houses in ashes. There is a discretionary power vested in my hands, which I shall try to exercise for a season, I do not say that you shall go now, but you must not think of staying there another season, or of putting in crops, for the moment you do the citizens will be upon you. I am determined to see the Governor's message fulfilled, but shall not come upon you immediately. Do not think that I shall act as I have done any more, - but if I have to come again the treaty which you have made here shall be broken, you need not expect any mercy, but extermination, for I am determined the Governor's order shall be executed. As for your leaders do not once think - - do not imagine for a moment, - do not let it enter your minds, - that they will be delivered, or that you will see their faces again, for their fate is fixed, their die is cast, their doom is sealed. I am sorry - gentlemen, to see so great a nember of apparently intelligent men found in the situation that you are and Oh, that I could invoke the spirit of the unknown God to rest upon you, and deliver you from that awful chain of superstition and liberate you from these fetters of fanaticism with which you are bound. I would advise you to scatter abroad, and never again organize with bishops, presidents, etc. lest you excite the jealousies of the people, and subject yourselves to the same calamities that have now come down upon you. You have always been the aggressors, you have brought upon yourselves these difficulties by being disaffected, and not being subject to rule, - and my advice is that you become as other citizens, lest by a recurrence of these events you bring upon yourselves irretrievable ruin." 671 By Mr. Southern, - "To these offers of proof we object on the ground that they are incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and have not been identified in a manner to make them competent testimony, - and the Defendants objects to the certificate of the Secretary of State marked Exhibit 27 on the ground that it does not show the continuation in office by Elias Higbee, as suggested in the proposition offering it in testimony." The further taking of depositions herein was hereupon continued until Friday the sixth day of May 1992, at which time (the hour of ten o'clock A.M.) appeared the partied hereto as hereinbefore set forth, and the further taking of said depositions was continued until Saturday the 7th day of May 1892 at the hour of 10 o'clock A.M. then and there to be continued at the place in that behalf first aforesaid, - Now on the 7th day of May 1892, the dame being Saturday, at the hour of 10 o'clock A.M. come the parties hereto as aforesaid, and the further taking of the depositions herein was continued, pursuant to adjournment, - Jacob Gregg, of lawful age, being produced, sworn and examined on the part of the plaintiff, testified as follows - - By Mr. E.L. Kelley, - "Before proceeding with the examination of this witness I wish to make this statement, - before we closed on the last day we were here I made the statement, which was accepted by the defendants as being the fact, that we would offer a certified copy of the articles of incorporation under the laws of the State of Illinois, - I have that copy here, and now which to offer it in evidence after you gentlemen have inspected it. Do you wish to examine it Mr. Southern?" By Mr. Southern, - "You can make your offer and I will examine it, and make my objects, if I have any." By Mr. Kelley, - "We offer it on evidence with the certificate and seal of the clerk attached, - and let it appear that we offer it in evidence in pursuance of the notice heretofore given, and have the same marked as an exhibit." (Marked as "Exhibit 30, J.M. Orr.") By Mr. Southern, - "Let me see that and examine it. We object to this document marked Exhibit 30, for the reason that it is incompetena, irrelevant and immaterial, and for want of proper legal certification and identification; and it is objected to for the further reason or specification because not religious incorporation has any standing in the courts of Missouri as the owner of reputed property in the State of Missouri."

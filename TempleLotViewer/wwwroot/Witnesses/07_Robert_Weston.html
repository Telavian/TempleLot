  <question>Can you state distinctly and definitely whether those people of whom you spoke a while ago were called Mormons, or more called Latter Day Saints?</question>
  <answer>I can't say what their name was for certain.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>26</questionnumber>
  <question>I do not ask you to state what their true appelation was, but simply to state whether they were called "Mormons", or called "Latter Day Saints"</question>
  <answer>Well I know outsiders like myself called them Mormons altogether.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>27</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr Weston are you right sure that you had ever heard then them then term "Latter Day Saints", at that time?</question>
  <answer>I would not say for certain because I do not know, - I don't remember, I would not say that I had or that I had not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>28</questionnumber>
  <question>You have heard that term, however?</question>
  <answer>How is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>29</questionnumber>
  <question>You are sure I say, that you have heard that term, - "Latter Day Saints" used?</question>
  <answer>Oh yes sir, often.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>30</questionnumber>
  <question>Have you not heard that more patricularly of recent years?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>31</questionnumber>
  <question>And you don't know that you ever head the term "Latter Day Saints" used during the time that Partridge was here or not?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Well now, -</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>32</questionnumber>
  <question>And you don't know whether you ever heard the term "Latter Dy Saints" applied to these people whom you have designated as Mormons during the time that Partridge was here or not?</question>
  <answer>Well we always called them Mormons, but I can't say posisitively what other names they might have called them, and I don't know whether they called them Latter Day Saints at that time or not, - I know I often heard that way of calling them but I can't say just when it was I first heard it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>33</questionnumber>
  <question>You know that they were called Mormons at that time?</question>
  <answer>I know that is what the outside people always called them that, - that is what the outsiders called them, but what they called themselves I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>34</questionnumber>
  <question>When you refer to other people claiming that property out there, - the property in controversy in this suit, you refer to the property you have indicated here as the temple lot?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>35</questionnumber>
  <question>Now whom do you maen as the other people?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that it is not cross examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>36</questionnumber>
  <question>What do you mean by other people claiming it, - whom do you mean claimed it?</question>
  <answer>Well the reason I say that is because Sam H. Woodson, John Maxwell and another man that lived down here by the river, they had a law suit about it, and they called on John Parker and old man Seagall, and some other fellow, - I don't know who it was just now, but I was to meet with them and the three of them wanted us to view the property and value it, and we went down there and looked around, and finally we decided what we thought it was worth, and they seemed to be having a law suit about it, or had a law suit about it and compromised it in some way, for I don't know just how it was, for one took one piece of it and the other took another piece. Now that is my recollection about it for I don't know just what the trouble was abut it, and never did know how it was.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness and to the question to which it is an answer on the ground that it is not cross examination, and moves the court to exclude the answer of the witness from the record for that reason.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>37</questionnumber>
  <question>
    Were they in possession of the property at that time, one or

  </question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is irrelevant and immeterial, not cross examination and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>It was open ground there and I don't know who had possession of it for certain.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>38</questionnumber>
  <question>Now when was that?</question>
  <answer>That was in, —what do you want to know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>39</questionnumber>
  <question>When was it that this occurence took place that you have detailed?</question>
  <answer>I couldn't tell you when it was, but old Steele lived here at the time, I can't tell you when it was. It was away back a long time before the war any way.</answer>

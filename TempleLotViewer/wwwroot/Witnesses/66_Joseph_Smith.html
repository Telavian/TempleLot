  <questionnumber>1</questionnumber>
  <question>For the purpose of showing the doctrine of the original church prior to the death of Joseph Smith the Seer, on the subject of secret oaths and covenants, I now hand the witness exhibit "F" and ask the witness to read paragraph thirty of chapter two on page three hundred and ninety five?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "That is objected to on the part of the defendants because it does not appear that the proposed testimony is in rebuttal, and because it is irrelevant and immaterial to any issues joined in the case." By Mr. Kelley,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>2</questionnumber>

  <answer>Is it section thirty?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>3</questionnumber>
  <question>No sir, it is paragraph thirty of section two?</question>
  <answer>
    "And it came to pass that they did have their signs, - yea their signs, and their secret words, and this that they might distinguish a brother who has entered into the covenants, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do, he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band who had taken this covenant; and thus they might murder and plunder, and steal and commit whoredoms, and all manner of wickedness contrary to the law of their country, and also the laws of their God: and whosoever of those that belonged to their band, should reveal unto the world of their wickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not according to the laws of their country, but according to the law of their wickedness which had been given by Gadianton and Kishkumen. Now behold it is their secret oaths forth to the world, lest they should be a means of bringing down the people unto destruction. Now behold these secret oaths and covenants did not come forth unto Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto Heleman: but behold they were put into the heart of Gadianton by that false being who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit; yea that same being who did plot with Cain and his followers from that tie forth. And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people to build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven. And it was that same being who led on the people that came from that tower into this land; who spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of the land, until he dragged the people down unto an entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell; yea it is that same being who put it

    </pagenumber>into the heart of Gedianton to still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he has brought it forth from the beginning of man, even down to this time. And behold it is he who is the author of all sin. And behold it is he who is the author of all sin. And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots and thier oaths, and their covenants and their plans of awful wickedness from generation to generation, according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men. And now behold he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites; yeah, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked; yea, the more part of them had turned out of the away of righteousness, and did trample under their feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto themselves idols of their gold and their silver.

And again, a commandment I give unto the church that it is expedient in me that they should assemble together at the Ohio, against the time that my servant Oliver Cowdery shall return unto them.

  </question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern "I object to that for the reason that I fail to see the value of the witness's testimony one way or the other in any reply that he can possibly make to the question, - that is, the answer of the witness could not be testimony bearing upon any of the issues of this case in any way, shape or manner, to matters not what it might be. By Mr. Kelley,</mono>

  <question>Was there there any arrangements looking towards that end in the room of your mother?</question>
  <answer>Looking towards what?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>126</questionnumber>
  <question>Looking towards preparations to that end, - that is, preparations for washings and anointings?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never knew of any. I did not know of it if there was. I slept in the adjoining room, unless I slept in the same room that father and mother did, and I never saw or heard of anything of the kind. We slept there all the time, for mother never allowed us to sleep away from her very far until after father's death.</answer>

    </pagenumber>name is Willis.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>140</questionnumber>
  <question>Her husband's name is Willis?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I believe she married a man by the name of Ira Willia--at least it is reported that she did.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>141</questionnumber>
  <question>In the testimony of Mrs. Willis, formerly Melissa Lott, taken in Salt Lake City, she makes a statement that in a conversation with you at Lehi in the Terrirory of Utah some years ago she claimed that she was married to your father, and lived with him as his wife in Nauvoo, Illinois. Now, what are the facts with reference to that conversation, if there was ever such a conversation?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern: I object to that. By Mr Kelley</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>142</questionnumber>
  <question>What, if any such a conversation was ever had?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern: Please indulge me for a minute or sp--give me time to read the examination of Mrs. Willis. (Reading testimon of Mrs. Willis.) Now, the objection to that question I take it, is that "several years ago" does not sufficiently identify the time in order to impeach her testimony by this witness. By Mr. Kelley</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>143</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, about four years ago--put it that way, Mr. Reporter.</question>
  <answer>If you will pardon me, I will say that in my crusade against polygamy there it had been stated that I would not dare to face Mrs. Willis, and when I went to Lehi preaching there, she was in the congregation on the first evening, and I secured an introdution to her and asked her for an interview, and I went the next day at ten o'clock by appointment to see her.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>144</questionnumber>
  <question>That was in Lehi?</question>
  <answer>Yes, sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>145</questionnumber>
  <question>Please state when this was.</question>
  <answer>This was in '85, and I think in the latter part of October.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>146</questionnumber>
  <question>Well, was that the only time and place you ever met her?</question>
  <answer>I called on her again on my way back when coming up from the south. I just merely called on here to say "how do you do" or something like that, and that was about all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>147</questionnumber>
  <question>Were these two visits the only ones you ever made to her?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that was all in Utah.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>148</questionnumber>
  <question>What were your reasons for calling on her?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, having known her in my boyhood, I was anxious to see her, and especially anxious to find out if I could, about what was stated in regard to her alleged connection with my father, and I went there and saw her and had a conversation with her in which she did state that she was married to my father, but she stated also that she did not live with him as his wife.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>149</questionnumber>
  <question>Is that all that she stated in that connection?</question>
  <answer>
    No, sir. After she had made that statement, I asked her the reason why she had not, and she said she did not think it was necessary. I asked her a number of questions with regard to it with the intention of ascertaining what the facts were in connection with it as near as I could, and she did not state that she had lived with him as his wife, but on the contrary, distinctly affirmed that she did not live with him as his wife. I asked her also if he had ever treated her as a wife, and she suggested that he did once, but nothing came of it, and I asked her why if she was properly married, why the relationship was not continued, and she said she did not think it was right. I asked her then if this took place in the Mansion House or in the old house, and she said no, that it was not in the Mansion House--that nothing ever went on in the old house or in the Mansion House.

    </pagenumber>She said that nothing of the kind ever took place there, and then I asked her, or stated to her, that it was said that he had several wives living there with him in the Mansion House, and she said it was not so, that nothing of the kind was carried on there, or permitted at all. Now of course it is impossible for me to remember all that was said or passed between us, but that was the substance of that passed between us at that time and place.

  <questionnumber>150</questionnumber>
  <question>Well state anything and everything that was said in the conversation?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "Well to that question I must interpose an objection?" By Mr. Kelley,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>151</questionnumber>
  <question>Well of course I mean upon that subject?</question>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "Well to that I object because it is not the proper inquiry to make in the impeachment of the witness."</mono>
  <answer>Well gentlemen, I am willing to state all I know for I have nothing to conceal about it.</answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Kelley,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>152</questionnumber>
  <question>What, if any thing, was said in those conversations of either of the conversations between yourself and Melissa Willis, with reference to your mother, or a statement made by your mother?</question>
  <answer>Well after asking her these questions, I asked her if my mother know of this marriage that she alleged had taken place.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>153</questionnumber>
  <question>What marriage do you refer to now?</question>
  <answer>That marriage that she alleged had taken place between herself and my father. I asked her if my mother knew that it has taken place or was aware of it in any way, and she said that mother was, - that she had given her consent to it, and then I asked her the question as to whether my mother was a truthful woman, - whether she was a woman that would tell the truth, and she said she would, - that that was her character, and then I said "suppose my mother should make to me a statement in answer to a question, could I rely on what she said" and she said "you can Joseph, you can, for if your mother told you anything you can believe it to be true and then I told her that my mother in answer to my question I had asked her, had stated positively that my father had no wife but my mother Emma, and that he had never had any other woman in any sense as his wife with her knowledge and consent, and then this woman Willis looked at me and said "Well Joseph if your mother told you that she knew nothing about it." Now that was all in the same conversation, and then I told her that my mother had made the statement to me specifically, and she said "you can rely on it then, your mother knew nothing about it." 154 (Mistakenly listed as number 134)</answer>
  <question>That was the conversation you had with Mrs. Willis formerly known as Melissa Lott?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>155</questionnumber>
  <question>Who was present during this conversation?</question>
  <answer>Soon after that her sister Mary, and her sister Alzina came into the room for they heard that I was there and was visiting Melissa I suppose, and so they came into the room to see me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>156</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what wass said then?</question>
  <answer>
    Well we fell into a general conversation. Of course I did not question the woman direction any more but in the course of the conversation I turned to Mary and asked her if she knew where I could find any brothers and sisters there in the territory, for it was reported that I had a good many mothers there in the territory, and I would like to find some brothers and sisters, for I was kind of lonesome, and Mary remarked that he had hunted the whole territory over for them, and went every

    </pagenumber>place where there was any report of the kind and she could find no children, and then Alzina spoke up and she said "No brother Joseph, I do not believe there is any chance for any", and then I turned to Melissa Willis, and I said "you hear what your sisters say, - what have you to say to it?"
  </answer>
  <mono>By Mr. Southern, - "Wait just a moment, - this line of evidence given in the answers of the witness is objectionable on legal grounds I think, - however proper it may seem on other grounds, It is objected to for the reason that it does not come up to the requirements of testimony in rebuttal or direct testimony, and it is objected to for the reason that it is so very clearly incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial to any issue in this case." By Mr. Kelley,</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>157</questionnumber>
  <question>Proceed Mr. Smith?</question>
  <answer>Well then Mrs Willis immediately remarked in answer to my question, that she though the girls were right.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>158</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what did she say about it?</question>
  <answer>She said "Joseph, I expect they are right" and then I said "I thank you, for I think that gives the case away." That was in effect what I remarked. The conversation was rather general after the girls came in, and having known them so well in the early days I felt free to converse with them as I would with those I had known for years. I was under no kind of reticence, or disinclination to talk with them for they were very friendly and we talked in a very friendly way.</answer>

  <question>I will ask you now if there is any rule, doctrine or teaching, tenet, rule or order or obligation in the church, - I mean in the re-organized church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, of which you are the president, which authorizes or countenances in any way, shape or form or manner, any secret oaths, ordinances, obligations, or any such thing as a part of its faith and practice, and the duty of its members?</question>

  <question>Is there any such teachings in any of the original books of the church, or records of the church, especially in 1830 say at the time the church was established then, and from that time on up to 1844 at the time of your father's death?</question>
  <answer>None that I know of. I know where is none in the books. It may be in the records, but I don't know about it if it is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>163</questionnumber>
  <question>Have any of the records of the church come into your possession teaching or authorizing any such practice?</question>
  <answer>There has none of them come into my possession or under my knowledge, therefore I know of nothing of the kind.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>164</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there anything in any of the books of doctrine of the church that would permit any such a thing?</question>

  <answer>I mean the Bible.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>173</questionnumber>
  <question>You mean just the Bible?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, the old and new testament, commonly called "The Bible".</answer>

  <question>You state that you understand it to be a correction of the translation?</question>
  <answer>No sir, that is not what I said, I said it was a translation and a correction.</answer>

  <answer>Yes sir, reasonably so, but I would not say that I am as familiar with it as some would be with the Bible.</answer>

  <question>Can you state whether or not it purports to be a revelation coming direct from God through the medium of your father, Joseph Smith?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question on the ground that it is not cross examination, and on the further ground that it is not material.</mono>
  <answer>I understand it to be as I have stated a correction and translation of the old and new testaments by the spirit of revelation, by Joseph Smith, my father. The history of it states that the translation was finished in 1838, and it came into my hands or possession some time prior to the date of its publication in 1867.</answer>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Nothing more than the fact of its being completed so far as we could discover when we came to examine the matter laid before us, - I should say presented to us.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>189</questionnumber>
  <question>It was completed so far s you could discover at that time?</question>

  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>191</questionnumber>
  <question>When did you state you first saw the manuscript from which this publication was made?</question>
  <answer>Well I could not tell you. I have not stated anything about it I don't think, but I will say now that I first say it when it came into my hands, or the hand of this committee a few months before the date of its publication on 1867.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>192</questionnumber>
  <question>Well can you state about the time when you first saw it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I can't state that specifically, but I saw it at different times in my mother's possession at different times, but I did not read any of it, - I simply saw the bulk of it, so to speak, in my mother's hands. Now in reply to the last question, I believe it was, I stated that the first time I saw it was when it was delivered to the committee of which I was a member, and that I think was the first time I saw it to read any of it, but before that I had seen it but not to read it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>193</questionnumber>
  <question>Did the manuscript that was delivered to you, purport to be a full and complete copy of the inspired translation?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects tot he question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>It purported to be what it was, - correction and translation of the old and new testaments, just as we have it here in this volume which was presented here called the Inspired Translation or the "Holy Scriptures."</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>194</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you speak of it as a manuscript, - now was it in the form of manuscript all written out?</question>
  <answer>No sir, it was not.</answer>

  <question>Then in what shape was this manuscript?</question>

  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reasons that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I can't tell you. I don't know about it. I stated at the outset that I understand it was completed in 1833, but I did not know it of my own knowledge as a matter of course, for in the very nature of things I could not know it to be a fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>254</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you understand from the same source that something was done with it after it was completed?</question>

  <questionnumber>256</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you understand from the same source that something was done with it after it was completed?</question>
  <answer>No sir, there is nothing more that I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>257</questionnumber>
  <question>That it was sealed up, - was that it?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that it was, - nothing more than it was put into custody and to be retained.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question and the answer of the witness for the reasons above set forth, and moves the court to strike the answer of the witness from the record for that reason.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>258</questionnumber>
  <question>To be re-opened when?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that it states that.</answer>

  <question>I will call your attention to that for the purpose of refreshing your recollection?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question for the further reason, that the cook from which the witness is asked to read is a mutilated book, and has never been introduced in evidence by either party and it was withdrawn after it was marked as an exhibit, for the reason that it was mutilated."</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>261</questionnumber>
  <question>I am simply asking the witness to refresh his memory. Is that the history to which you refer?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>262</questionnumber>
  <question>That paragraph to which I called your attention?</question>
  <answer>it may be. It probably is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>263</questionnumber>
  <question>Now after you have refreshed your memory you can state in the same connection as to whether this Inspired Translation was finished, and as to whether anything else was said about it as to what was done with it?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question for the reasons above stated.</mono>
  <answer>I can state what appears there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>264</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is stated there?</question>

  </answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the answer of the witness on the ground that it is incompetent.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>265</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is this as authentic a part of the history as the other part of the history which you quoted this morning? That is, is it as authentic as the other part you quoted this morning as to when t was finished?</question>
  <answer>I presume it is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>266</questionnumber>
  <question>You consider that it is just as authentic?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I don't doubt its authenticity.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>267</questionnumber>
  <question>No you were asked this morning I believe by the plaintiffs in this case to state if you know from whom the manuscript for this inspired translation was obtained, and you stated did you not that it was obtained from your mother?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>268</questionnumber>
  <question>You stated that it was obtained from you mother Emma Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. The committee that published it obtained it from here.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>269</questionnumber>
  <question>That is a fact?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>270</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you not also state that you were one of that committee?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I was a member of that committee and it was delivered to me in person.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>271</questionnumber>
  <question>It was delivered to you in person from your mother Emma Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. Her name was not Smith at the time that I obtained it from her. Her name was Mrs. Bidaman at the time that I got that translation from her.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>272</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you remember about what date that was?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I do not. If I had known that the date was required I could easily have obtained it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>275</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you can probably approximate it, can you not?</question>
  <answer>I think it was some time in the fall of 1867.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>274</questionnumber>
  <question>Well how long was it on hand with the committee or anywhere else after you obtained it?</question>
  <answer>How long was it on hand?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>275</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>In what way, -the committee had it all the time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>276</questionnumber>
  <question>I mean before anything was done with it, how long was it on hand?</question>
  <answer>Well we went to work on it right away at once. We were at work on it for some time, for it was some months before it went into the hands of the printers in Philadelphia.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>277</questionnumber>
  <question>Who went to work on it?</question>
  <answer>There was myself, Ebeneezer Robinson, W.W. Blair, and the clerks we employed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>278</questionnumber>
  <question>You all went to work on it you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>279</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what work was there to do on it?</question>
  <answer>We recopied it, -made a copy of it for the printers, that is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>280</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you make a verbatim copy?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we did so far as we possibly could do it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>281</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you make a copy in the manuscript?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir we made it in manuscript, for we had no typewriters then as we have now</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>283</questionnumber>
  <question>Well when I used the word "manuscript" I use the word in its old signification?</question>
  <answer>Handwriting?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>284</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, it was copied in hand writing.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>285</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was it all copied in hand writing before it went into the hands of the printers?</question>
  <answer>yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>286</questionnumber>
  <question>By that committee?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, or by person employed by the committee.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>287</questionnumber>
  <question>By them or by persons employed by them.</question>
  <answer>Well I should say by them and by persons employed by them.</answer>

  <questionnumber>288</questionnumber>
  <question>When you made the manuscript, - wait a moment and I will get that right, - when you obtained the manuscript or the copy from which you made the manuscript, from which you made the manuscript copy, from your mother, what was its condition, - that is what shape was it at the time you obtained it from your mother?</question>
  <answer>Well it was a mass of manuscript or copy secured in a bundle by itself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>289</questionnumber>
  <question>It was all by itself?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>290</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now was it secured?</question>
  <answer>Wrapped up and secured with the requisite twine.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>291</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there any covering on it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>292</questionnumber>
  <question>Thee was a wrapper on it then?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>293</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there any seal to that wrapper?</question>
  <answer>I don't know that there was any specific seal to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>294</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe you stated, - I believe you did not state positively that it was sealed in any way at the time you got it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't know, - I will state now that I don't know that there were any wax seals on it, but there may have been wager seals on the outside of the cover, and if so they may have been broken.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>295</questionnumber>
  <question>You do not recollect now though, that there was any seals on it?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>296</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know that your father had a seal that was called is private seal?</question>
  <answer>No sir. I don't know about that. I could not say. There may have been and I think there was a church seal in the office, but I rather think he did not have what could be called a private seal of his own that he used for his own individual use.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>297</questionnumber>
  <question>You did not recognize any seal of that kind to the manuscript or on the wrapper that was around it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, there was not any seal of that character.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>298</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe that you stated that you had seen that manuscript prior to the time when that committee applied for it?</question>
  <answer>Well I don't know that I have stated that to be the fact, but it is the fact. I have seen it as a bundle or mass, but not for the purpose of examining it, - I simply saw the bulk of it so to speak. I never had examined or read it though.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>299</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you ever open it before that time?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>300</questionnumber>
  <question>Had it the appearance of having been opened?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Oh I could not say as to that. I said it had not the appearance of having been opened, but there is something I could not say, for it might have been opened for all I know to the contrary.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>301</questionnumber>
  <question>It was in the custody of your mother you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>302</questionnumber>
  <question>And the committee got it from her?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>303</questionnumber>
  <question>Will you state where she got it, if you know?</question>
  <answer>I suppose from my father.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>304</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know where she kept it?</question>
  <answer>I can state where it was when I knew where it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>305</questionnumber>
  <question>Well where was it when you knew?</question>
  <answer>It was in her private bureau in her private room.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>306</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know by what authority, if there was any particular authority, that she became the custodian of that manuscript?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I cannot say that I do know of any specific authority by which she had it in her custody, or how she was made the custodian for it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>307</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know whether or not it was claimed that she was to be the custodian of it?</question>
  <answer>
    I may have heard some such thing as that
    <pagenumber>
      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0002_f0008-Pages_92-193-ORIGINAL/72.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 157</a>
    </pagenumber>but I can't say whether it was a claim or not.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>308</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know that she was ever made the custodian to retain possession and charge of it?</question>
  <answer>No sir, but I think it was a very good thing however to leave it in her charge, for she undoubtedly took the best care of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>309</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think that it was a very good thing that she had it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>310</questionnumber>
  <question>You think, of course, that she was faithful in her charge?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>311</questionnumber>
  <question>You do?</question>
  <answer>I do.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>312</questionnumber>
  <question>Well can you state, or do you know why it was that she delivered it up to the committee?</question>
  <answer>I know what she said about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>313</questionnumber>
  <question>Well state what she said about it, for I believe that would be competent?</question>
  <answer>She said that she had been entrusted with it, and she had kept it as faith- fully as she could, and she was glad to be relieved of its care, and she believed that she had put it into the right hands, and that the time had come for it to be published. That is what she said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>314</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know what was the cause of its being applied for through the committee?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>315</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what was the cause?</question>
  <answer>There was a resolution passed through the conference authorizing the ap- pointment of a committee to apply for it, and to pub- lish it, if it could be obtained. i</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>316</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the way the committee came to be appointed</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>317</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know if there was anything behind the ac- tion of the conference that caused the conference to pass that resolution?</question>
  <answer>Nothing more than the desire we had that it should be published, and our believe that the time had come when it should be pub- lished.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>318</questionnumber>
  <question>That was the reasons?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. That is all the reasons I know of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>319</questionnumber>
  <question>Was there, or is there any authority in the book of doctrine and covenants, or any where else, that appoin- ted, or directed the conference toward the getting of that manuscript and its publication?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not that I am aware of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>320</questionnumber>
  <question>There is not anything that directs that that should be done?</question>
  <answer>No sire, not that I am aware of, - nothing that specifically directs that it should be done. At least if there is anything I do not now recall it. We simply believed that it came in under our general work and we saw fir to secure possession of it and publish it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>321</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you know whetther there is anything called a revelation in the book of Doctrine and Covenants that refers to the inspired translation?</question>
  <answer>Nothing more than the appelative, - the "Scriptures". It is either the "Scriptures" or the "Holy Scriptures."</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>322</questionnumber>
  <question>I may be mistaken and if I am correct me, - I under- stood you to state this morning that there was a re- velation published in the book of Doctrine and Cove- nants, in pursuance of which this translation was made? Did I understand you correctly when I under- stood you to say that?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I think you asked me the question if there was any revelation to that effect, and I answered you that I did not know what there was, but there were references made to it which we had read.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>323</questionnumber>
  <question>This morning was that stated?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, referring to it as identifying the Holy Scriptures, or the in- spired translation.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>324</questionnumber>
  <question>How was that?</question>
  <answer>
    Well you asked me to question if I knew of any re- velation commanding it to be done, and I told you that
    <pagenumber>
      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0002_f0008-Pages_92-193-ORIGINAL/68.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 158</a>
    </pagenumber>there was not any that I knew of.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>325</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that is what I have reference to, if you understand the revelation to which your attention was called this morning in the book of Doctrine and Covenants to refer to the making of this translation?</question>
  <answer>Well that is the question you asked me before and I answered no, that it referred to the article itself as we understand it to identify the work and in answer to the question as to whether I knew of any specific commandment authorizing or commanding the translation to be made, that was the question you asked me and I told you no.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>326</questionnumber>
  <question>Please refer me now to the revelation, to the date of the revelation or about the date of the revelation to which you referred this morning in your direct examination?</question>
  <answer>One is in section thirty, and the other is in section fifty eight. Perhaps the first one is in section thirty one, for I don't remember exactly the dates.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>327</questionnumber>
  <question>What I was getting at Mr. Smith was to develop whether the revelation was received prior to the translation or subsequent to it?</question>
  <answer>Well that was the understanding I had of your question when you asked me before if I knew of any revelation authorizing this translation to be performed, and I told you that I did not. I believe that this here refers to the document or article.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>328</questionnumber>
  <question>What makes you arrive at that conclusion?</question>
  <answer>Well it says in section thirteen, paragraph fifteen, that is one of them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>329</questionnumber>
  <question>Now it might not be objectionable even to the plaintiff's attorney for me to inquire just this much further about this, as to whether the revelations which appear to be in the inspired translation and not is the King James translation of the bible. I mean the differences or changes that are in the inspired translation and not in the King James translation, were ever submitted to the quorums of the reorganized church for their adoption?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial and not cross examination, and for the reason that it does not appear that any revelation appears in the new inspired translation and the witness has not so stated.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>330</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I did not say that he did, I don't see that you ought to object to that question. What is the question? (Question No 329 was repeated to counsel)</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>331</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, that is my question, and I don't think you should object to that at all, answer the question?</question>
  <answer>The revelations as they appear there have never been submitted to the quorums in the form which you ask.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>332</questionnumber>
  <question>They have never been submitted to the quorums of the church of which you are the President?</question>
  <answer>No sir, the book itself has been submitted to the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>333</questionnumber>
  <question>I think that I may properly go one step further, and enquire whether you did not state in your direct examination last February that the revelations to be authentic and binding upon the church must first be submitted to the quorums?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is immaterial and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>334</questionnumber>
  <question>
    That all revelations and everything affecting the church had to first be submitted to the quorums for their approval, and if approved
    <pagenumber>
      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0002_f0008-Pages_92-193-ORIGINAL/74.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 159</a>
    </pagenumber>they became authentic, and if disapproved they were not?
  </question>
  <answer>I said then as I do now that that which purports to be revelations, before they can become binding as matters of law to the church, the rule is that they be submitted to the quorums and meet with their approval. That is what I stated then and that is what I state now.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>335</questionnumber>
  <question>They must first be submitted to the quorums for their approval?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, for their examination and approval before they become law.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>336</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then are revelations considered as binding when they are submitted to the representative counsellings of the church, and endorsed in that capacity?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial and not cross examination.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>337</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>That depends matters presented to the conferences may be adopted by them and thereby become standards of reference in the settlement of disputes or controversies that may not even be in the form of revelation, and in that way they become binding upon the church.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>338</questionnumber>
  <question>If they are not revelations they have the same effect?</question>
  <answer>If they have the effect upon the church of changing its organization or rules or laws, or anything of that kind, they have to be submitted to the church. Conferences may adopt resolutions governing its own work, and a resolution so adopted is binding upon the conference, but not as binding as a revelation, and it is not binding upon the church for the reason that it has not been submitted in the way that a revelation has to be submitted or anything that has the effect of changing the laws or rules of the church or affecting a question of doctrine.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>339</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now is it not a fact that you do not regard that inspired translation as a revelation?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>340</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it a fact that you do not regard the inspired translation as a revelation?</question>
  <answer>We regard it, and take it for just what it purports to be, a correction and translation of the old and new testaments by the spirit of inspiration by Joseph Smith, and place it side by side with the book of Mormon and the Covenants.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>341</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you consider it infallible?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>342</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you consider the Bible to be infallible?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons last above set forth.</mono>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>343</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you do not consider the Bible to infallible?</question>
  <answer>No sir, we do not consider anything that passes through human hands to be infallible. We do not even hold the laws of the State of Missouri to be infallible. We do not believe in the plenary inspiration of the Bible and therefore do not believe it to be infallible.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>344</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>345</questionnumber>
  <question>
    And you express the same views with reference to

      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0002_f0008-Pages_92-193-ORIGINAL/75.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 160</a>
    </pagenumber>the book of Mormon?
  </question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reason and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>346</questionnumber>
  <question>As to its fallibility or infallibility?</question>
  <answer>Understand me, - we hold that everything that passes through human hands to be fallible. We don't believe that any thing that passes through human hands must necessarily be perfect, there fore we hold that everything that passes through human hands is mutable and therefore not infallible.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>347</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now is that your view with reference to the revelations in the book of Doctrine and Covenants? Is that you review with reference to the revelations as printed in the book of Doctrine and covenants which you have adopted?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons set forth in the preceding objection.</mono>
  <answer>Taking that book as a whole that is our view regarding it. Now let me illustrate, - in the Inspired Translation we find in the new testament scripture we find this kind of thing in reference to Jonah being three days in the belly of the whale, it says "as Jonah was three days in the heard of the whale, so shall the son of man, etc. now that is manifestly an error, and we do not therefore believe it, for it is so manifestly an error that it is not necessary to believe it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>348</questionnumber>
  <question>And you find that in the new translation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>349</questionnumber>
  <question>In the Inspired Translation?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>350</questionnumber>
  <question>Well is it correct?</question>
  <answer>Certainly it is not, - it is a typographical error.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>351</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you ever look to see where that error arose?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we have examined, and it was not in the manuscript or in the copy that was furnished the printer, but it is an error in the proof reading.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>352</questionnumber>
  <question>That is where the error was?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, in the proof reading. It was an error of the printer that set up the type that escaped the proof reader.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>353</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now do you, or do you not hold that that original manuscript, from which the inspired translation was made, was itself infallible?</question>

  <questionnumber>354</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you don't even hold that that is infallible?</question>
  <answer>No sir, we do not hold anything to be infallible that passes through human hands, I have told you that at least six time, - that we don't hold anything to be infallible that passes through human hands, for they are all of them subject to human mutations.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>355</questionnumber>
  <question>That is a revelation to whom?</question>
  <answer>
    It is the translation and correction of the old and new testament made by Joseph Smith through the gift and the spirit of inspiration. Now to show you that human error has crept into even the King James translation as it is called, there is one place where it tells you that the disciples were all out on the water, and they were filled with water, and if that is so they were in a queer fix. If they were filled fear it would be a different thing, but it says that they were filled with water. Now you would not say that the human, - that the bible was infallible in that respect. Now in another place it says that they waked up in the morning, and it says that they were dead men, and in another place in Isaiah it says "I will" send

    </pagenumber>them a servant that is blind and dead." That is not infallible. I only quote these instances to show that everything that passes through human hands is mutable and cannot be considered as infallible, and to that end I could go on and offer further proof if it was necessary. As a further instance in the King James translation where it states that a son began to reign two years before his father. Now there may be errors of that kind in the inspired translation, and if there is any they are fallible, for they are the result of human agency, and therefore fallible. It is for these reasons that I hold that anything that passes through human hands is liable to error and hence cannot be claimed to be infallible.

  <question>Well will you apply the same line of reasoning to the plates from which Joseph Smith translated the book of Mormon?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not cross examination and calling for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>I will say this that the plates say themselves that if there are errors in them they are the errors of men.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>357</questionnumber>
  <question>And you say the same of the original manuscripts from which the King James translation was made?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons above set forth.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>358</questionnumber>
  <question>And the reasons and examples yo have given is what you predicate that opinion upon?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir I say that for the reason that we have no manuscript or any knowledge of any that goes very much back of the fourth century of the Christion era, and the most of them date from about the seventh or the eighth century, and surely all of these are subject to human mutations.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>359</questionnumber>
  <question>Now let me ask you this question, - is there anything in your church either in doctrine or practice or what is considered to be authority that you regard as infallible?</question>
  <answer>So far as our action or allegiance to any rule or doctrine of faith or practice is concerned, - so far as anything comes and is accepted by the church as a rule for its guidance either in faith or practice the matter of fallibility or infallibility does not enter into the question. There is no tribunal this side of the Judgment seat of God that can determine whether anything is true or is not true, but when anything is accepted of course it is binding upon the church, although we do not attempt to pass upon the question of fallibility or infallibility. We simple decide these matters according to the light that is given to us, and we are liable to be in error, for we recognize that this side of the judgement seat there is no tribunal that can decide that matter.</answer>

    </pagenumber>what we have received on the same subject, or what is in the bible, the book of Mormon and the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and we find that it is not at variance with anything there, and it is then received as a revelation from God, why then it becomes binding upon us as a belief, and we conform to it, - that is we take it and give it the same force as the statute law.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>363</questionnumber>
  <question>Do you then regard it as fallible or infallible?</question>
  <answer>We take it without reference to its fallibility or infallibility. We do not attempt to decide that, for the fallibility or infallibility of its character is to be determined bye and bye.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>364</questionnumber>
  <question>At the risk of repeating a question that has been asked before probably, I will ask you if it is the position of your church that the authority of a revelation from God depends upon its endorsement by a man, or by any body of men?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and is not cross examination, and call purely and simply for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>365</questionnumber>
  <question>Answer the question?</question>
  <answer>That which is or was presented to us as a revelation from God is examined, and if in our opinion it be subversive of that which has been received before as revelations from God and accepted as the doctrine of the church, then it is rejected.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>366</questionnumber>
  <question>You reject it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, we take the risk of rejection it in that case, although it may be from God. It does not derive its authority from God, - it derives its authority from our acceptance of it, - in other words its authority and force as a binding mandate upon us derives its authority or weight in that rerpect from our acceptance of it, - authority merges in it upon our acceptance, and not until then.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>367</questionnumber>
  <question>Now then you have stated in your examination in chief, - as I understand it, - you have stated in your evidence as I understand it that the re-organized church is precisely like the church prior to the death of Joseph Smith with reference to a certain doctrine or doctrines?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects tot he question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I made no such an answer to any such a question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>368</questionnumber>
  <question>I did not say you made any such an answer to any such a question, - the question I asked you was if I understood you correctly when I understood you in your direct examination to say that the re-organized church at the present time, and always has been similar to the church prior to the death of Joseph Smith?</question>

  <questionnumber>368</questionnumber>
  <question>Well we will take what the witness says about it, for your recollection and mine differs as to that proposition?</question>
  <answer>Well sir, I will say this what I am mistaken if any such a question was asked me, for if it was I have no recollection of it whatever.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>369</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you say you have no recollection of such a question being asked you on your direct examination?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't recollect it now if it was, but I am willing to answer the question however. I have no objection to answering it at all. Neither that or any other question.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>370</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what is your answer?</question>
  <answer>It may be so, but if it is, it is within the line of fallibility. My answer to that is the same in character as the other answers.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>371</questionnumber>
  <question>That brings us up to a great deal that was said this morning as I remember it in reference to secret societies in the church I believe?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I recollect that that question was up.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>372</questionnumber>
  <question>Now am I mistaken when I say that I understand you to maintain that there is no secrets in the re-organized church?</question>
  <answer>I have not said anything about it for I have not said there was or was not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>373</questionnumber>
  <question>You have not?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>374</questionnumber>
  <question>Well then my memory is certainly at fault if you have not?</question>
  <answer>You certainly are in error if you suppose or assume that I have, for what I said was that I knew of none that were authorized by the books, and none were existing as a duty and obligation on the part of the members that were imposed by the church as a duty or obligation on its members.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>375</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr. Smith you have reached exactly the point I want to get at, - ?</question>
  <answer>Recollect I say there is none that I know of, for I am speaking within my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>376</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I want to predicate a question upon that, - and it is this, - whether though you claim that certain lines of conduct are not authorized by rule or precept, yet they may be practiced in the church?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>I will say that there is no such a practice authorized or sanctioned by the church at all. The church simply does not propose to interfere with the privileges and desires of its membership in that respect. If they choose to belong to the Masons or Odd fellows or any other secret organization they are at liberty to do so as far as the church is concerned. That is their privilege and they can belong to the Knights of Phythias or any other organization so long as they preserve the rights of citizenship and general good conduct. The church doe snot propose to interfere with them for belonging to any of these orders.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>377</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that anticipates my question, for I was going to ask you if you disciplined them for belonging to these organizations?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I have never known of a case where that was done. I have never known of a case where it was necessary or where it was thought of. It is simply a question of personal privilege that the church does not propose to interfere with. The church as far as that is concerned neither teaches nor endorses nor sanctions nor condemns these secret organizations, - it stands perfectly neutral on that question.</answer>

    </pagenumber>authoritative which prohibits the revealment of certain things to the world at large?
  </question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the grounds and for the reasons that it is not proper cross examination, and is incompe- tent, irrelevant and immaterial.</mono>
  <answer>I know of nothing that prevents me from telling everything I know to the world on proper occasions.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>379</questionnumber>
  <question>Does that answer apply equally to everything that was or is practiced in the church?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. So far as I have any knowledge of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>380</questionnumber>
  <question>That has always been the case you say?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. No man has ever been asked not to answer a question, or charged not to reveal anything he knows in regard to the church or its doctrines, practice or organiza- tion. That is the face Colonel, neither is there a rule in the church that puts a stopper on the tongue on any man or his conscience.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>381</questionnumber>
  <question>A man then is perfectly free in that regard?</question>
  <answer>He is.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>382</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe you have also stated, that there is nothing in your doctrine prescribing a penalty for indulging in those things that are found in some societies, - secret societies by the member of your church?</question>
  <answer>I will not say that, for I don't know what obliga- tions are imposed on members of the church in secret organizations which they may join. I cannot say as to that, for I am not familiar with their practices in that regard. Now to illustrate I will say that any member that joins any secret society that is sub- versive of human rights such a practice is reprehen- sible by the rules of the church, and is condemned by the church, but the church don't know what they are.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>383</questionnumber>
  <question>Now Mr Smith, if there was some doctrine or practice in regard to anointing the head with oil or other parts of the body, - some habit or practice, or form pre- scribing a certain kind of dress to be worn, an initia- tory rite, - have you anywhere in your church anything that fixes a penalty, so that the member participating in it shall be excluded from the church or otherwise punished for so doing?</question>
  <answer>If there was any rule of the church prohibiting anything of that kind, there would be a penalty attached, but as there is no rule there consequently is not any penalty.</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is not cross exam- ination, and is irrelevant and immaterial.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>384</questionnumber>
  <question>You say there is no such a rule in your church?</question>
  <answer>There is no such a rule that I know anything about, further than the Doctrine and Covenants says "let your garments be clean, and the ornaments there- of the work of your own hands," There is no rule that requires any person in an initiatory ordinance to wear any particular kind of a garment, or to be or- dained in any particular kind of dress made after any particular fashion.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>385</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there a principle recognized in your church that Christ himself instructed his disciples not to reveal certain mysteries of the kingdom?</question>
  <answer>We read the command of the Saviour to his disci- ples, and accept it for just what it purports to be. That is what we do, for there is no rule amongst us in reference to it at all.</answer>

  <question>Are not the teachings of Christ an authority with you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>387</questionnumber>
  <question>You accept the teachings of Christ as authority?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, of course we do. They are an authority with us so far as they are applicable.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>388</questionnumber>
  <question>And are they not all applicable?</question>
  <answer>I presume not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>389</questionnumber>
  <question>Are any of them fallible?</question>
  <answer>We are not disposed to state that that which came from the Saviour is fallible, Christ is the only law giver, - the only infallible law giver which we know anything about. We do not claim that he is fallible, but we do claim that the translation of his commands or words came through human hands, that the version we have of it that in so far as it has been affected by human agency is fallible, or may be fallible.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>390</questionnumber>
  <question>Is there not a statement in the book of Covenants that such things are not to be given to the world?</question>
  <answer>There is a commandment or statement in the book of Covenants that certain things that they had amongst them at that time, - whatever they were, - were not to be revealed.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>391</questionnumber>
  <question>Well do you recognize that statement as an authoritative law of your church?</question>
  <answer>I could not say, but I would know if I knew what those specific things are that were thus prohibited.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>392</questionnumber>
  <question>You have been enquired of as I see it at some length, with regard to what you knew as to your father's conduct and habits, while you were a boy at home there in Nauvoo?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>393</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that was enquired into very extensively?</question>
  <answer>It was inquired into, but as to whether or not it was extensively inquired into that would be a matter of opinion.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>394</questionnumber>
  <question>Well for that reason, may I not, with your approbation - pursue the inquiry a little further?</question>
  <answer>I have no objection sir, for I am here to answer any question you may ask me.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>395</questionnumber>
  <question>Mr Smith will appreciate the feeling which prompts me to ask the question in that way?</question>
  <answer>Well Colonel you will understand that I have no feeling in the matter, so proceed with your inquiry without regard to my feelings, for I have none whatever in the matter.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>396</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I thought you would appreciate the feeling that actuated me when I put the question in that form?</question>
  <answer>I repeat that I have no feeling, and I am here to answer any and every question that is legitimate, or that has any bearing in this case in any way shape or form. I will answer any question you put to me that meets with these requirements.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>397</questionnumber>
  <question>Well with that understanding we will proceed. At the outset of the inquiry it would be proper to inquire, wouldn't it, as to what was your age when your father died?</question>
  <answer>He was killed in June and I would have been twelve years old the next November.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>398</questionnumber>
  <question>He was killed in June and you would have been twelve in the following November?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. I was just lacking the number of months of being twelve years of age, that there is between June and November. He was killed on June 27th and I was twelve years old the following 6th of November.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>399</questionnumber>

  <questionnumber>401</questionnumber>
  <question>Now if it be a fact Mr. Smith that your father indulged in the practice or practices, about which the inquiries have been made this morning of you, - is it now a fact that he would have taken special pains to conceal for you, his twelve year old son, and his ten year old son or his eleven year old son, or whatever your age was, - is it not a fact that he would have taken special pains to conceal it from you?</question>
  <answer>What is that I don't just exactly get at what you mean?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>402</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I asked you if it is not a fact that if your father indulged in the practice or practices about which you were questioned this morning, that he would have taken especial pains to have concealed from you his ten or twelve year old son, the fact that he was indulging in those parctices?</question>
  <answer>I cannot answer that question Colonel.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>403</questionnumber>
  <question>You say you cannot answer that question?</question>
  <answer>No sir that is more than I can say, for anything I might say on that matter would be merely my opinion.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>404</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I think an opinion on that would not be out of the way?</question>
  <answer>Well when it comes to that I don't know that I have any opinion on the subject, and all that I have to say that he would be a wise man who, indulging in that practice would keep it from his family.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>405</questionnumber>
  <question>You think it would be a wise man that would keep it from his family?</question>
  <answer>I certainly think that he would display wisdom, who practicing practices like that would keep it from his family. I would consider it an evidence of caution in him to do so that would be commendable at least as evidencing his desire to avoid trouble over the matter.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>406</questionnumber>
  <question>You think that he would be a wise man?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I know that if I was doing anything like that that I would try and keep it from my boys, for I would not want them to know anything of the kind, especially the elder one.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>407</questionnumber>
  <question>You would not want to let your boys know anything about it?</question>
  <answer>Certainly not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>408</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now if your father was practicing these parctices would he not be likely to keep it from you if possible?</question>
  <answer>I have no answer to make other than I have. I know what i would do about it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>409</questionnumber>
  <question>Well that rule of action would be equally applicable to his wife, - that is to your father's wife, and your mother Emma Smith wouldn't it?</question>
  <answer>Well I am only presuming in reference to this, so I will say that I presume so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>410</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you need not make it as a presumption, - might not you state it as a fact from what you know of the shrewdness and ability of your father?</question>
  <answer>What is that?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>411</questionnumber>
  <question>I say you need not put it in the form of a presumption, for would you not state that that is the fact from what you know of the shrewdness and ability and general character of your father, - would you not say taking these things into consideration that the course you have stated as being the one you would pursue would be the one that he would follow?</question>
  <answer>I will tell you Colonel that so far as my knowledge goes, there was never anything of the kind known in the family, and I will say further that I believe that it was absolutely impossible for such things to have been without my knowledge.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>412</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I understand you have already stated that?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I have and that is the fact.</answer>

    </pagenumber>least doubt in the world as to your sincerity and implicit belief in what you state?
  </question>
  <answer>Well that is the fact, -I don't believe there was ever such a thing dreampt of even before father's death, and for that reason any other answer that I might give would be merely supposing a case which I am convinced never had the shadow of a foundation in fact. I cannot say what would be the action or judgment of my father in keeping it a secret. I simply state the fact that such a thing was never known in the family or even whispered or dreampt of, and what his motives were in keeping it a secret, supposing he actually practiced it, is something that I am unable to state. What might have been his methods and motives for and and of concealing it from the family, or keeping it a secret so the family would not know anything about it, I am not prepared to say, assuming of course for the same of argument, so to speak, that he had actually practice it and did keep it a secret from his family.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>414</questionnumber>
  <question>Now you have been testifying have you not with reference to your knowledge of these matters?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I presume I have.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>514</questionnumber>
  <question>Well don't you know you have been Mr. Smith?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, as far as my knowledge goes I have.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>416</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, I take it so?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that is a fact.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>417</questionnumber>
  <question>Now what I am inquiring about is whether the presumptions are not all against your having any knowledge of these transactions?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff object to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, not cross examination and calls for an opinion of the witness only.</mono>
  <answer>I think not. I can't see it in that light Colonel.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>418</questionnumber>
  <question>You think not?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir. You asked me for my presumption, and my presumption is that the absolute absence of any knowledge of that kind on the part of his family, leads me to believe that there is nothing in it, and that there is no truth in fact in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>420</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now assuming that he was guilty of these practices is it not a reasonable presumption that your father would have concealed it from his family?</question>
  <answer>No sir. Not under the conditions alleged, for it is charged that his wife know of it and consented to it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>421</questionnumber>
  <question>Well viewing it in the light that there was no such a charge made, that she was privy to it, I am not proceeding upon the assumption that she was privy to it, -I am proceeding upon the assumption that she was not privy to it, and ask you if it is not the presumption that if your father was guilty of these practices, wouldn't he have taken the necessary steps to conceal it from his family? In that connection I might say your father or any body else's father?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I should think he would have done so if he was guilty.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>422</questionnumber>
  <question>And if he did do so, what he did was successful?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I don't say that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>423</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I say if he did do so he was successful in concealing it from his wife and family?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I would say that if he did do so he was successful in concealing it from his wife and family.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>424</questionnumber>
  <question>Well now that is an answer to my question?</question>
  <answer>yes sir, I hope it is.</answer>

    </pagenumber>a guard there around the house during the last days of his life, -or perhaps I should say during the latter part of his life?
  </question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness for the reasons and on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper examination.</mono>
  <answer>I never knew of any guard being stationed around the premises until after my father's death, and know there was then when my mother was moved out of the Mansion house and lived across the road. There was a guard set there then. I know this, that the time of the attempted abduction to Missouri, there was for a few days parties on watch and in the house, but I never knew of any one being stationed around the house for what you would call a guard.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>426</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you say there was no guard?</question>
  <answer>No sir, there was no guard that I know of. There may have been individuals there watching, but I am confident there was no guard at any time only the time that I have spoken of, - that is, there was no one that was recognized by the family as men on guard. I know that it has been frequently stated that there was men on guard, but if there was at any time other than this time of the attempted abduction to Missouri, that I know nothing of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>427</questionnumber>
  <question>Now I would be pleased for you to answer this question, - whether your mother ever gave you directions at any time to look after your mother's whereabouts?</question>
  <answer>Never unless she wanted him and sent me after him, and then I know I never found him any place but where he had a legitimate right to be.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>428</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you always find him?</question>
  <answer>No sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>429</questionnumber>
  <question>Why not?</question>
  <answer>Well if he mounted his horse and went out in the country ten or twelve miles I could not find him. If he went out in the country on business of course I could not find him, but if he was called out of the office to administer to same one or some of the duties of his position then of course I would not find him. My father was a busy man, and there was not much of his time spent in idleness, and I don't think he had much time other than that necessary to attend to the legitimate duties of his position. 430</answer>
  <question>Sometimes you say you would not find him?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, and I never was sent for him except in proper hours either.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>431</questionnumber>
  <question>I believe, - at any rate I will ask you the question as to whether or not the re-organized church has published a biography of your father?</question>
  <answer>A biography of my father?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>432</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir, an auto-biography of your father and of yourself?</question>
  <answer>The office has published a book in which there is a chapter written by myself.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>433</questionnumber>
  <question>What is it about?</question>
  <answer>Something in regard to my own history.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>434</questionnumber>
  <question>And of course you maintain that is true to the best of your knowledge and belief?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not cross examination.</mono>
  <answer>Yes sir, so far as I know it is true.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>435</questionnumber>
  <question>Is it or is it not a fact that you knew prior to your father's daeth that he was charged with the practice of polygamy?</question>
  <answer>I knew nothing about it prior to his death. I simply saw it as it was stated in the Times and Seasons.</answer>

  <question>That was with reference to the charges made by John C. Bennett?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>438</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you familiar also with the charges made in the Expositor?</question>
  <answer>I never saw the Expositor at that time. I never saw it until after his death. I will say that I never at any time saw but one copy of it until the time that I saw the copy that was published here last spring. I saw one, or a part of one of the original papers before that.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>439</questionnumber>
  <question>What was the substance or character of the charges that you saw in the Expositor prior to his death?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the plaintiff objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is not cross examination, and is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial</mono>
  <answer>I did not see it prior to his death. I said I saw it after his death.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>440</questionnumber>
  <question>After the death of your father?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>

  <question>How long after his death was it that you saw it?</question>
  <answer>Oh I could not say how long it was.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>442</questionnumber>
  <question>You can't say when it was, only that is was after his death that you saw it?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>443</questionnumber>
  <question>Was the publication that you saw made prior to his death?</question>
  <answer>I think not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>444</questionnumber>
  <question>Where was it published?</question>
  <answer>I think it was published in that paper that was destroyed there.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>445</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the Expositor?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>446</questionnumber>
  <question>Were you or were you not present at the time of the destruction of the office of the expositor?</question>
  <answer>I was not.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>447</questionnumber>
  <question>Did you hear any statements made at or about that time by your father, with reference to the destruction of the Expositor?</question>
  <answer>Did I hear any statements from him?</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>448</questionnumber>
  <question>Yes sir?</question>
  <answer>I remember hearing him tell a crowd of men on the street that they had done that which would cause us trouble. That is what I heard him say.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>449</questionnumber>
  <question>How many men was there in that crowd?</question>
  <answer>There was some forty or fifty.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>450</questionnumber>
  <question>That is all the statement that you heard him make, is it, with reference to the destruction of the press?</question>
  <answer>I don't know what it referred to. I only inferred that it referred to that from the circumstances.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>451</questionnumber>
  <question>Well what else was said in that speech that you remember?</question>
  <answer>Well you could not call it a speech, for it was not made in the form of a speech. They were on the street, these men were, and had come down the street together, and I heard him make that statement to them.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>452</questionnumber>
  <question>And you did not know what it was he referred to that would cause or make trouble?</question>
  <answer>No sir, not from anything he said, but as I have already stated, I inferred that it referred to that matter of the destruction of the office. I knew that from the excitement that prevailed there. Now that is what I thought, but it is only my belief. I might be fallible about it Colonel,-I don't pretend to state it as a fact, but only as a conclusion of mine, which of course is liable to error.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>453</questionnumber>
  <question>I understand you to say that you knew the time and the day when the office was destroyed?</question>
  <answer>
    Yes sir. I knew it as a passing event though I was not present. I think there is no doubt but that was

    </pagenumber>the fact, for I saw some of the type from the office that was picked up after it was destroyed. Now Col- onel, that was the way I knew it, simply as a passing event, or an event that had already occurred, although I was not present. Don't imagine that I am defending the act, for I would not defend such an act though it was committed by anybody. It was a wrong thing to do and not defensible on any ground whatever, no matter who did it.

    By P.P. Kelely, - "I now offer in evidence o the part of the plaintiff from exhibit "L" being the "Times and Seasons", Saturday October 1st, 1842, in rebuttal, and offer that part on page nine hundred and thirty nine commencing at the middle of the first column at the words "On marriage" and from thence on down to the words "Abigail Works", in the middle of the first column on page nine hundred and forty, being the same part of the book that was introduced i evidence in connection with the cross examination of a witness in Salt Lake City, and ask that the reporter in corporate it in the record as a part thereof." By Mr. Southern.- "That is objected on the ground of irrelevancy and because it is not rebuttal." The following is a true and correct copy of the extract

      <a href="/images/MS_1160_b0002_f0008-Pages_92-193-ORIGINAL/90.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page 175</a>
    </pagenumber>From Exhibit "L" above referred to. On Marriage. According to the custom of all civilized nations, marriage is regulated by laws and ceremonies; therefore we believe that all marriages in this church of Christ of Latter Day Saints, should be solemnized in a public meeting or feast, prepared for that purpose; and that the solemnization should be performed by a presiding High Priest, high priest, bishop, elder, or priest, not even prohibiting those persons who are desirous to get married, of being married by other authority. We believe that it is not right to prohibit members of this church from marrying out of the church, if it be there determination so to do, but such persons will be considered weak in the faith of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Marriage should be celebrated with prayer and thanksgiving, and at the solemnization, the persons to be married standing together, the man on the right and the woman on the left, shall be addressed by the person officiating, as he shall be directed by the Holly Spirit; and if there be no legal objection, he shall say, calling each by their names: "You both mutually agree to be each others' companion, husband and wife, observing the legal rights belonging to this condition; that is keeping yourselves wholly for each other, and from all others during your lives." And when they have answered "yes" he shall pronounce them "husband and wife" in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the laws of the country and authority vested in him; "May God add his blessings and keep you to fulfill your covenants from henceforth and forever. Amen." The clerk of every church should keep a record of all marriages solemnized in his branch. All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is baptized into this church, should be held sacred and fulfilled. In as much as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy; we declare that one man should have but one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again. It is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will of her husband, neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband. All children are bound by law to obey their parents; and to influence them to embrace any religious faith or to be baptized, or leave their parents without their consent, is unlawful and unjust. We believe that husbands -parents and masters who exercise control over their wives, children and servants and prevent them from embracing the truth, will have to answer for that sin. We have given the above rule of marriage as the only one practiced in this church, to show that Dr. J. C. Bennett's "secret wife system" is a matter of his own manufacture; and further to dis-abuse the public ear, and show that the said Bennett and his misanthropic friend Origen Bachelor, are perpetrating a foul and infamous slander upon an innocent people, and need but to be known to be hated and despised. In support of this position we present the following certificates:- We the undersigned members of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and residents of the city of Nauvoo, persons of families, do hereby certify and declare that we know of no other rule or system of marriage than the one published from the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and we give this certificate to show that Dr. J C. Bennett's "secret wife system" is a creature of his own make, as we know of no such society in this place, nor never did. S. Bennett. N.K. Whitney 176 George Miller. Albert Pettey. Alpheus Cutler.

C. Bennett's "secret wife system" is a disclosure of his own make. Emma Smith, President. Elizabeth Ann Whitney, Counselor. Sarah M. Cleveland, Counselor. Eliza R. Snow, Secretary. Mary C. Miller.

By Mr. Kelley, - "I now offer from the Times and Seasons, dated November 15th 1844, the editorial statement of John Taylor, as follows, - "For the communication of "an old man in Israel" and the letter of Elder Addison Pratt, from the islands of the Pacific Ocean, we bespeak a hearty welcome. They are genuine." Also the following from the communication of "An Old Man in Israel" commencing in the middle of page seven hundred and fifteen in the second column, with the words "the saints", and down to, - well including the whole of the paragraph. By Mr. Southern, - "That is all objected to for the reason that there is no authority for the publication of the church, or an article published by the church or by its authority. This objection goes to both the last offors of the plaintiff." By Mr. Kelley, - "This is the same article that was introduced by the plaintiffs in cross examination of the defendants' witnesses in Utah last March." By Mr. Southern, - "Our objections made to these extracts from exhibit "o", - I want to be distinctly understood and stated all the way through, - we object to them as irrelevant and not rebuttal. This objection will be made to all the extracts offered or to be hereafter offered by the plaintiffs." The extract above referred to last offered by the plaintiffs, is in words and figures as follows, - "The saints of the last days have witnessed the outgoings and incomings of so many apostates that nothing but truth has any effect upon them. In the present instance, after the sham quotations of Sidney and his clique, from the bible, book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants, to skulk off under the "dreadful splendor" of "spiritual wifery" which is brought into the account as graciously as if the law of the land allowed a man a plurality of wives, is fiendish, and like the rest of Sidney's revelation just because he wanted "to go to Pittsburg and live." Woe 177 to the man or men who will thus willingly lie to injure an innocent people. The law of the land and the rules of the church do not allow one man to have more than one wife alive at once, but if any man's wife die, he has a right to marry another, and to be sealed to both for eternity; to the living and the dead. There is no law of God or man against it. This is all the spiritual wife system that was ever tolerated in the church and they know it." By Mr. Kelley, - "I now offer from the Times and Seasons published Thursday, February 1st 1844, volume 5, page four hundred and twenty three, from exhibit "0" the notice, commencing at the bottom of the page in the first column, and ending at the top of the second column, with the word "church". In corporate that in full in the record." The extract from exhibit "0" above referred to, is in words and figures as follows, - Notice As we have lately been credibly informed, that an elder of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, by the name of Hiram Brown, and been preaching polygamy, and other false and corrupt doctrines, in the county of Bapeer, state of Michigan. This is to notify him and the church in general, that he has been cut off from the church, for his iniguity; and he is further notified to appear at the special conference, on the 6th of April next, to make answer to these charges. Joseph Smith Hyrum Smith Presidents of said church. We also offer from the same exhibit as above mentioned, under date of Monday April 1st, 1844, on page four hundred and ninety, from the middle of the first column commencing with the heading "To the Elders abroad. down to and including the word "principles" in the first column of page four hundred and ninity one inclusive. Incorporate that also in full in the record." By Mr. Hall, - "That is objected to on the ground of irrelevancy, and there is no signature showing by what authority it was made or published." The extract from exhibit above offerred in evidence by the plaintiff is in words and figures as follows, - To the Elders abroad. We very frequently receive letters from Elders and individuals aboard, inquiring of us whether certain statements that they hear, and have written to them, are true; some pertaining to John C. Bennett's spiritual wife system, others in regard to immoral conduct, practiced by individuals, and sanctioned by the church: and as it is impossible for us to answer all of them, we take this opportunity for answering them all, once for all. In the first place we cannot but express our surprise, that any elder or priest who has been in Nauvoo, and has had an opportunity of hearing the principles of truth advanced, should for one moment given credence to the idea that anything like iniquity is practiced, much less taught or sanctioned, by the authorities of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. We are the more surprised, since ever species of iniquity is spoken against, and exposed publicly at the stand and every means made use of that possibly can be, to suppress vice, both religious and civil; not only so, but every species of iniquity has frequently been exposed in the 178 Times and Seasons, and its practicers and advocates held up to the world as corrupt men that ought to be avoided. We are, however, living in the "last days", a time when the scriptures say "men shall wax worse, and worse; deceiving and being deceived", in a time when it is declared, "if it is possible the very elect should be deceived." We have in our midst corrupt men (and let no man be astonished at this, for "the net shall gather in of
    every kind, good and bad") these corrupt men circulate corrupt principles, for a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit; these spread their pernicious influence abroad, "they hatch cockatrices eggs, and weave the spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper, their words eat as doth a canker, the poison of asps is under their tongues, and the way of peace they have not known." Such men not unfrequently go abroad and prey upon the credulity of the people, probably have clandestinely obtained an ordination, and go forth as elders, the more effectually to impose upon the public. Some have got horses, and others money, under specious pretences, from the unwary and unsuspecting among the newly formed branches who have not had all the sagacity to detect them. There are other men who are corrupt and sensual, and who teach corrupt principles for the sake of gratifying their sensual appetites, at the expense and ruin of virtue and innocence. Such men ought to be avoided as pests to society, and be frowned down upon with contempt by every virtuous man and woman. All of the above of whatever name or nature, are "reprobate concerning the faith"; if they write, they write corruptly; if they speak, they speak corruptly. They are such as the apostle speaks of, they speak "great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration". - They are high and lifted up, and would trample upon the humble and meek, and the unassuming, and are not afraid to teach for the commandment of God their own corrupt and devilish doctrines and principles; let no man therefore, be deceived by them, let no man harbor them, not bid them God speed; don't be partakers of their evil deeds. If any man writes to you, or preaches to you, doctrines contrary to the Bible, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Doctrine and Covenants, set him down as an imposter. You need not write to us to know what you are to do with such men; you have the authority with you. Try them by the principles contained in the acknowledged word of God; if they preach or teach or practice contrary to that, disfellowship them; cut them off from among you as useless and dangerous branches, and if they are belonging to any of the quorums in the church, report them to the presidents of the quorum to which they belong, and if you cannot find that out, if they are members of an official standing, belonging to Nauvoo, report them to us. Follow after purity, virtue, holiness, integrity, Godliness, and every thing that has a tendency to exalt and ennoble the human mind; and shun every man who teaches any other principles. It being impossible to conclude the taking of the depositions in rebuttal herein, on this day, the further taking of the same is continued until Monday, August 15th at the hour of ten o'clock in the forenoon, to be continued at the place last aforesaid. Now on this Monday the 15th day of August 1892, at the hour of ten o'clock, the same being the hour to which the taking of depositions herein was continued as aforesaid, come the parties hereto, and the further taking of testimony herein in rebuttal, on behalf of the plaintiff

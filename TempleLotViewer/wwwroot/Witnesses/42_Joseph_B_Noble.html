  <questionnumber>222</questionnumber>
  <question>They were the bishops when they were raising the money to buy land in Missouri, were they not?</question>
  <answer>With regard to the raising of that money it may be one side of that date or the other. I can't say to the time that that was done, for it may be a little before that date or a little after it. I can't tell you when it was for I don't know much about that of my own knowledge, although there was some money raised I think.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>223</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I don't care a straw whether it was in '31, '32, or '33, but there was money raised at one time to purchase land in Missouri for the church?</question>
  <answer>As I said before, I heard sounds of it but I did not see it.</answer>

  <questionnumber>228</questionnumber>
  <question>In Jackson County, Missouri, at Independence?</question>
  <answer>No sir, I did not because I did not stand by and see it done. What I know about it is what I heard about it, but I did not stand by and see it done, so I don't know it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>229</questionnumber>
  <question>You don't know anything only what you stand by and see done, -is that it?</question>
  <answer>Well now now, I have lost about all there was in my noggin, and there ain't but little left in it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>230</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you heard the reports in the church about it?</question>

  <question>You heard Bishop Partridge talk about it didn't you?</question>
  <answer>&nbsp;</answer>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendant objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, and calls for hearsay testimony, when the witness should be permitted to testify to facts only.</mono>
  
  <questionnumber>233</questionnumber>
  <question>You heard it talked and preached or proclaimed from the pulpit in the church did you not?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reason set forth in the last preceding objection.</mono>
  <answer>
    I heard some talk about it, but how deep and how far, and to what extent or length it went I do not know. I don't know that because I did not have anything to do with it.

  <question>Yes sir.</question>
  <answer>No sir, I never was in the county, but when I was up through that section of country I was close enough to see it. I went up on the hills along the river over in Clay County and looked over and saw it.</answer>

  <answer>Yes sir that is what they said.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>242</questionnumber>
  <question>I did not call them that name, then why do you call them that? Do you think it is sharp and witty to term them that?</question>

  <answer>No sir, I just said that because that was the name we went by amongst some people, but I don't think we deserved it at all. They were boys, a good many of them, and it was put that way just for fun.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>245</questionnumber>
  <question>Who put it that way in the first place?</question>

  <answer>Yes sir, I heard it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>248</questionnumber>

  <question>You say you did not hear him say anything about it.</question>
  <answer>That I do not recollect of.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>250</questionnumber>
  <question>You remember though what he said about "Zion's Scamps", but you can't recollect if he ever said any thing about the temple lot.</question>
  <answer>Well I remember these nonsensical things, and I don't recollect these other things at all.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>251</questionnumber>
  <question>Well did you not hear Brigham say something about the temple lot?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness on the ground and for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, hearsay.</mono>

  <questionnumber>258</questionnumber>
  <question>Then you mean to say that Zion's Camp extended from Kirtland Ohio, to Clay County, Missouri?</question>

    </pagenumber>or what they told me was Jackson County, and so it could not have been so very far.
  </answer>
  
  <questionnumber>261</questionnumber>
  <question>It was just a few miles they told you?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir the Missouri river separated them, -that was all they said.</answer>

  <question>And that was all that did separate them?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, that was all that I knew anything about.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>263</questionnumber>
  <question>Just the distance across the Missouri river?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I suppose so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>264</questionnumber>
  <question>Why did you not go over into Jackson County and settle on those lands there?</question>
  <mono>Counsel for the defendants objects to the question asked the witness for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not proper cross examination, and calls for an opinion of the witness.</mono>
  <answer>I don't know.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>265</questionnumber>
  <question>Why did you not go over into Jackson County, and settle on the lands there when you were so near them, -when there was only the river between you and them?</question>
  <answer>Well that was not our object in getting up there. We were just a traveling camp.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>266</questionnumber>
  <question>Was it not because the church had just been driven off its lands there, and the members of the church, and you were not permitted to go over there?</question>
  <answer>Yes sir, I think so.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>267</questionnumber>
  <question>Well don't you know that was the reason?</question>
  <answer>I guess that covers it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>268</questionnumber>
  <question>That is the fact bout it?</question>
  <answer>I think it is close to it anyway. They were driven off their land and we went up there to see if they could be re-instated, for they were mobbed out of the county I understood. There was a good many of the pole who had been driven out and they told me about it man a time.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>269</questionnumber>
  <question>And the reason you did not go back to Jackson County was because you did not consider it safe for you to go, -is that not it?</question>
  <answer>Well that has something to do with it.</answer>

  <questionnumber>273</questionnumber>
  <question>Well you could have that in a few days and die, but how long did it take you to have it?</question>
  <answer>It took us between twenty and thirty hours to dig through the worst of it.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>274</questionnumber>
  <question>Well was that as long as you stayed in Clay County?</question>
  <answer>Well I guess it was a little longer, -a few days longer.</answer>

I know I had the cholera there nigh unto death, but through the grace of God, assisted by the prophet, I recovered and regained my usual good health, but i ow that I assisted in burying four out of the company of us that were there, before I left.</answer>
  
  <questionnumber>277</questionnumber>
  <question>Well I am not asking you about that, - I am asking you about the time that you left there?</question>
  <answer>Well I thought you wanted to know all that we were up to there.</answer>

  <answer>I don't remember the date, for dates are always a trouble to me.</answer>

    <question>Not until after she had become a member of the church did you?</question>
    <answer>She was baptized before that, - and she was baptized before I married her to Joseph Smith but I am now studying up the date that Alva Beeman moved to Kirtland, for at that time I know that the prophet went down into the river there, and he baptized Father Beeman and his family. I had gone up there to Kirtland with one girl out of the family came up there to Kirtland afterwards and were baptized into the church, but I can't give you precisely the date.

Woe to the man or men who will this willfully lie to injure an innocent people. The law of the land and the rules of the church do not allow one man to have more than one wife alive at once, but if any man's wife die he has a right to marry another, and to be sealed to both for eternity, to the living and the dead. there is no law of God or man against it.
